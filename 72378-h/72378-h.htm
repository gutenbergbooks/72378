<h4>THE SORCERER’S STONE<br>
</h4>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was dark in the <i>marea</i>, yet not so
dark but that the Marquis and I could
see about us. We had been inside this
New Guinea temple, or club-house, or Parliament
building—you might call it a little
of all three, and not go very far wrong—for
over half an hour, and our eyes were
getting accustomed to the gloom.</p>

<p>There were thirty or forty men in it,
squatting about the floor, or lying on the
bamboo shelves they used as beds. In the
brown dusk of the unwindowed building,
they seemed to melt into their surroundings
like ghosts, for they were brown too,
and wore no clothes save a bark loin-cloth.
You could see the whites of their eyes, and
their bead necklaces, and the halos of colored
feathers they wore in their hair—little
more. They were smoking, chewing betel-nut,
and spitting its blood-red juice out on
the floor—grunting, scratching, staring at
us. They had heads like a soldier’s fur
busby; their bodies were small, according
to white men’s standards, but they were
notably well-made and muscled, and evenly
developed. Most of them had wooden
spears and tall war-bows lying on the
ground within reach; and the walls of the
<i>marea</i> were covered with clubs, shields,
spears and bunches of barbed arrows.</p>

<p>The scene was old to me—old to weariness.
I had been in these temples, or
others like them, more times than I could
count, recruiting boys for some island trip,
trading, getting food. It was true that I
had never been in this especial district of
New Guinea, but I did not see much difference
between the savages I knew and
the savages I didn’t know. And anyhow,
I had long since lost interest in them, save
as a means of making money.</p>

<p>But the Marquis, I think, felt it to be
the moment of his life.</p>

<p>There he sat, on a pile of our baggage,
as on a throne, holding his head erect, and
swelling out from the chest even more
than usual—which is to say something,
for the Marquis is six feet four, and weighs
near eighteen stone. He had come the
whole way from France to study—what do
you think? Magic—of which he had heard
there was plenty in New Guinea. So there
is: it is the greatest nuisance in the country,
and I for my part would as soon think of
going out to look for red ants or for stinging-tree.
But the Marquis took what he called
a scientific interest in the occult—which
meant that he was bored for want of a little
honest hard work to do, and didn’t know
it—and I had had bad luck with my last
prospecting trip into the interior: lost four
carriers (clubbed and eaten) and two mates
(blackwater fever) and found nothing.</p>

<p>So I was rather glad to take on the Marquis,
when he turned up in Port Moresby
wanting a resident of the country to find
carriers for him and lead a trip through the
country lying about the coast. I thought
I might light on payable gold after all—I’ve
always had an idea that there might
be something in the Kata-Kata country,
and I thought, too, that I could do with a
quiet, peaceful, easy sort of trip for once,
after the kind of thing I had been having.</p>

<p>Quiet! Peaceful! Just wait till I have
done.</p>

<p>It looked peaceful enough that evening,
at all events. We had had a fairly long
tramp to get to the village—which is celebrated
all over Kata-Kata as the headquarters
of local sorcery—and had not
arrived till sundown. The Marquis, on
hearing that the Kata-Kata people were
not cannibals, had insisted on sleeping in
the <i>marea</i> instead of in our tents. It would
be better for his purpose of studying the
natural man and his connection with the
occult—so he said. I thought it might turn
out in his seeing a little more natural man
than he wanted, since the Kata-Kata folk
were by reputation a nasty lot, and had
been man-eaters ten years ago, though the
Government had sent punitive expeditions
in often enough to reform them since then.</p>

<p>Unless the Marquis was asleep, or eating,
he never stopped talking. His English was
not quite English, but you could understand
it all right; at any rate, he did not
talk like a Frenchman on the stage. He
was talking now, and I was not listening
closely; it went in at one ear and out at
the other. The village men, crouched on
the ground, chewed, and spat red, and
looked out at him from under their sullen
brows.</p>

<p>They did not like us very much, it
struck me. They were not accustomed to
white people up there, except with punitive
expeditions, which do not exactly smooth
the way for those who come after.</p>

<p>Our interpreter—who could not interpret
very much of the Kata-Kata talk after all—had
told us that Mo, the big sorcerer,
was out in the forest making spells, but that
he would be in at sundown, and then perhaps
he might consent, if we gave him
plenty of tobacco and a lot of salt, to show us
something. We had been waiting for him
a good while, but there was no sign of Mo.</p>

<p>I was getting quite sleepy, as I sat on
the ground, smoking and thinking. It had
grown darker; the men had thrown some
cocoanut shells on the pile of hot ashes in
the center of the floor, and a small, fierce
blaze had sprung up, showing the white
boar-tusk bracelets on the brown arms, and
the quiver of the long head-feathers. The
Marquis, I knew without listening, was
telling me about a “dear woman who loved
him—a beautiful, a kind”—because he was
twisting the ends of his mustache while he
talked—he always did that when he began
sentimental confidences, and the ends of his
mustache, in consequence, were like nothing
but long, sharp pins.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, he dropped his hands,
sprang off the throne of sacks like a wallaby—he
was wonderfully light on his feet,
for his size—and went down the ladder
leading from the door to the ground, in
two jumps. I had been sitting with my
back to the doorway, and could not see
what it was that had agitated him; however,
I got up, without undue haste, undid
the fastening of the revolver holster that was
strapped to my belt, and went down the
ladder after the Marquis.</p>

<p>The village street was wide and sandy,
reflecting back the light; there was a young
moon coming up now above the cocoanut
palms, and the sharp brown gables of the
houses stood out clear among the stars. I
could see the natives slipping like shadows
in and out among the platforms and supporting
piles all down the street; I saw a
wolf-like kangaroo dog sitting in the moon,
and a small tame cassowary taking a running
kick at it, as it went past. But I
could not see the Marquis.</p>

<p>This did not altogether please me, for
Kata-Kata is a good way outside Government
influence, and things might happen,
though they are not likely to. I walked
about in the soft sand for a minute or two,
and stopped to look and listen. I could
hear nothing of the Marquis, but I heard
what located him for me just as well as a
flood of French or English conversation—the
coy, pleased, flattered giggle of a girl.</p>

<p>I made straight for the sound, and there
in the growing moonlight, behind the white
stems of a clump of betel-palm, was the
Marquis—dancing.</p>

<p>I have not mentioned it—being unaccustomed
to writing, and apt to lose my way—but
I ought to have said that the Marquis
had two special fads, and they were
sorcery and dancing. He knew all about
every dance that had ever been danced in
the history of the world, from David’s
fandango before the ark, down to Genée’s
latest pirouette at the Empire. And, in
spite of his height and weight, he could
dance them all himself, more or less, but
mostly more.</p>

<p>You might have thought he would look
ridiculous when he danced, but he did not:
no man looks ridiculous doing that which
he does supremely well. He did not look
ridiculous even now—pink, fat, a bit disheveled,
stepping and springing, advancing
and retreating, and wreathing his fat arms
above his bullet head, here in the moonlight,
behind a clump of betel, with a grass-kilted,
giggling New Guinea girl looking on
at the mad procedure.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->


<p>“Hallo, Mark!” I said (I used to call him
that, because, being only a plain Australian
without much schooling, I never could remember
or pronounce his own extraordinary
name). “What are you dancing?”</p>

<p>“It is the Love Dance of the Red Men of
Roraima,” said the Marquis, doing something
quite extraordinary—I think with
the calves of his legs, but he was too quick
for one to see.</p>

<p>“Why the Love Dance, and why Red
Men?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Because,” said the Marquis, beginning
to walk with a cross-swaying motion that
really was fine—like Indian corn blowing in
the wind—“I desire to find the key to the
heart of this little beautiful, since I saw
her on the steps of the <i>marea</i>; and the
dance talks, even when one does not know
a word of their own blessed language. And
the Red Men—I chose their dance because
they will, without doubt, be spiritually akin
to the soul of this <i>boshter</i> little kid.”</p>

<p>The girl drew up one leg under her grass
crinoline like a hen, and giggled as if she
understood. She was really pretty—if a
New Guinea girl is ever pretty; I do not
admire them myself, but it is all a matter
of taste. She was lighter in color than
most, a sort of golden brown, and of
course, being a young savage, and not a
civilized person, she had a perfect figure.
She had the little, aristocratic-looking hands
these Papuans often have (their hands, I
reckon, are like those of the old families
among white people, because neither Papuans
nor old families ever do a stroke of
work that they can help), and she had big
eyes and a bush of hair, and was a good
deal dolled up with red and yellow flowers
and pearl-shell necklaces and things.</p>

<p>All the same, she was just a little nigger,
and the Marquis never ought to have flattered
her by taking notice of her. It puts
them out of their place.</p>

<p>Still, he went on dancing, and I really
forgot about the girl for a little, watching
him. It was so good, and the scene was so
extraordinary—the open space of sandy
soil, all lit up by the moon, and that great
figure, dancing with incomparable lightness,
against the background of long banana
leaf and slender betel palm, like a very new
sort of fairy in a very strange kind of fairy
glade.</p>

<p>Then I happened to glance at the girl,
and immediately all my amusement went
out like a candle in the wind, and I fell to
counting up what this especial freak of the
Marquis’ might be likely to cost us. For
the little Papuan, who had been standing
some way off at first, chewing her necklace
and giggling, had suddenly turned quite
grave—solemn, even—and was advancing,
step by step, like some one in a dream,
toward the space where the Marquis
danced. Her hands were spread out as if
she were blind, and her eyes never looked
at the ground, or the moonlight, or the
village houses showing through the trees—only
at the Marquis, dancing. And she
stepped nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>I don’t go about with cotton-wool in my
ears in the Papuan bush country, even
when things are—or seem—as quiet as
Sunday evening church in Sydney with the
wrong girl alongside of you. I heard something
moving in the scrub that wasn’t a
pig or a dog; the Marquis didn’t hear it,
for he was whistling softly to himself all the
time he danced, and the girl didn’t, for she
was hypnotized, or something like it. But
I thought it as well to stop the circus just
there; so, without looking round, I went
forward, grabbed the Marquis by the shoulder,
and said, “Cut it out!”</p>

<p>He had been long enough in my company
by this time to know that I had generally
very good reasons for anything I might
say or do.</p>

<p>He stopped—not without a turn or two
to finish it off nicely—and, responding to a
pinch on the arm, moved away with me
quite amicably. When we got back to the
<i>marea</i>—the girl had vanished, somehow, as
these natives can, without one’s even seeing
how—he asked me what the matter
was.</p>

<p>I did not answer him at first, for I was
annoyed at the whole proceeding. Of
course, I knew that he was only bent on a
little trifling amusement—the Marquis let
off most of his feelings in talk, and never
took anything what you might call seriously—but
all the same, he ought to have
remembered, I thought, that we were in a
strange, possibly a hostile country, and not
have started flirting with any “little beautiful”
before we had been an hour in the
town.</p>

<p>So I sat down on the floor of the <i>marea</i>
again, and lit my pipe before I would
answer.</p>

<p>“Flint, my very good friend, I fear that
you are in a blooming wax,” said the Marquis.
“Why should you wax with me?
What have I done?”</p>

<p>I took out my pipe. “You don’t seem to
remember,” I said, “that we’re in a hostile
country. I’d be obliged if you would.” I
put back my pipe.</p>

<p>“What did you see?” asked the Marquis,
quite grave and sensible now.</p>

<p>“I saw nothing,” I said. “I don’t know
that there was anything. But I think I
heard—the little creak that some of these
big blackwood bows make.”</p>

<p>“When you take them to your bosom
and pull hard?” asked the Marquis, who
had been trying his strength on some of
these weapons, and had been a good deal
impressed by their power.</p>

<p>“Just that,” I said. “I wouldn’t dance
the Love Dance of the Red Men of Roraima
any more, if I were you. Or I wouldn’t
dance it at that particular girl. Or at any
girl.”</p>

<p>“She is a beautiful,” said the Marquis.
“She is what you Australians, in your
touching symbolism, call a tart. I remember
an Australian little girl, in——”</p>

<p>He had got hold of both sides of his mustache—I
saw that I was in for the deluge,
so I cut it short.</p>

<p>“I believe that’s your sorcerer coming at
last,” I said.</p>

<p>There was a noise of throbbing drums in
the village, a tramping down the street,
that evidently foretold the commencement
of the evening dance. Now, it was hardly
to be supposed that the village would begin
its entertainment before the sorcerer came
back from his spells in the forest to join in
the revels. I told the Marquis this, and
suggested we should have some trade stuff
taken out of the packs in readiness. We
got one of our boys to untie a sack or so, and
selected some beads, knives, salt and tobacco.</p>

<p>“And here is the sorcerer, back from his
spelling,” declared the Marquis, peering
through the door at a tall, fine-looking man
who was striding down the street with a
general air of owning the whole place. He
carried a big torch in his hand, and had a
netted string bag over one shoulder. Slung
on his breast was a large, hollow piece of
bamboo, which he took some care to keep
in a perpendicular position. His face,
rather a fine one for a New Guinea native,
showed clearly in the light of his torch: it
was painted in stripes of black and scarlet,
with a very fiendish effect. On his head
was a magnificent head-dress of paradise
and parrot feathers, rising fully three or
four feet above his mat of hair. He had
no clothes except a bark belt, and did not
wear the bead and shell necklaces affected
by most of the other people. There was
something slung round his throat like a
locket; it swayed about so that I could not
see what it was.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the sorcerer without a
doubt,” I said. “He’s making right here.”</p>

<p>He was; and our interpreter, a timid little
lad from the coast, was so terrified at
the sight that he ran and hid himself
at the back of the <i>marea</i>, and had to be
dragged out by force. By the time we had
succeeded in quieting him down and assuring
him that our weapons would protect us
all from any sorcerer, the man was at the
steps and mounting them.</p>

<p>In the light of the fire we saw at last
what his locket was. I took it, at first, for
a monkey’s paw, but, remembering that
there are no monkeys in New Guinea, I
had another look, and then realized that it
was a human hand, dead and dried.</p>

<p>The Marquis looked at the ugly ornament
much as a collector of insects looks at
a hideous and valuable beetle.</p>

<p>“Flint, this is what you call the real
Mackay,” he said. “This is the worth of
my money.” He rose, and was about to
greet the sorcerer with all the grace of
Versailles—in fact, he had already begun a
courtly bow—when a small and very ugly
man, with ears like a bat, came running
out of the dark from nowhere, and grabbed
the great man by the foot, as he went up.</p>

<p>“Mo! Mo!” he cried; and then came a
flood of native, intermingled with the wildest
gestures. The ugly little man beat the
air with his hands, thumped himself in the
ribs, jumped up and down till the feathers
on his head waved like cocoanut leaves in
a hurricane, and all the time yelled, chattered,
gasped and choked. Mo, who had
come down the ladder again at the first
word, stood looking at the furious little
creature with an absolutely inexpressive face.</p>

<p>“What’s he saying?” I asked our interpreter,
Koppi Koko.</p>

<p>The native’s face grew purposely blank
and dull. “I no savvy,” he said.</p>

<p>“You do savvy,” I told him, beginning
to unbuckle my belt.</p>

<p>“I savvy, I savvy,” he cried nervously.
“Savvy little bit. That fellow man, him
telling Mo some one make gammon along
him, he no like. That fellow, he brother
along Mo. ’Fore God, Taubada [master],
I no more I savvy.”</p>

<p>He seemed a good deal scared about
something, and when a Papuan is thoroughly
scared, you may leave him alone
for all you will get out of him. I said no
more, and the furious little man, after a
final jump and yell, shoved something
into Mo’s hand and bolted away under
the house like a rat. The sorcerer put
his hand into his string bag for a moment,
drew it out empty and mounted the ladder
once more.</p>

<p>You could not tell what he thought, or
if he thought anything, so complete was the
veil of indifference he had drawn over his
face. He had of course heard of our arrival
in the village, so I was not surprised at his
taking our visit as calmly as he did. But
I did not—quite—like the way he had accepted
the plaint of the bat-eared little man.</p>

<p>The rickety floor of sago-sheath creaked
and dipped as Mo strode up the building.
He went straight to where the Marquis and
I were standing, folded his arms over his
breast and uttered something in native
that was evidently a greeting. The Marquis
bowed, took his hand and shook it.
I nodded at him. Mo turned aside a
minute to hang up the hollow bamboo he
carried so carefully (we could see it was
plugged at one end with wood), and then
swept Koppi Koko to him with a gesture
of one hand.</p>

<p>We were great chiefs, no doubt, he said;
he was glad we had come to see his village.
Did we belong to the Government?</p>

<p>We assured him we did not—knowing
that Kata-Kata had probably been saving
up a good long score to settle with His
Majesty’s representatives, since the last
punitive expedition. This great chief, I
said (through Koppi Koko), had come a
very long way from his village, which was
many, many moons away, to see Mo and
hear about his wonderful doings. If Mo
would show him any sorcery, he would
give much tobacco and salt and beads,
and other treasures. And (since sorcery
is illegal) he would promise not to tell the
Government anything about it.</p>

<p>While I talked, I could hear the dance
getting ready in the village: feet were
stamping; drums were throbbing with the
intoxicating triple beat that all Papuan
travelers know; loud, brassy voices were
rising and falling in a monotonous chorus.
I was glad to hear them, for I know the difference
between songs of peace and songs of
war, and this was not one of the latter.</p>

<p>Still—many years in New Guinea have
given me an instinct for danger that has
nothing at all to do with sight or hearing;
and it was stirring, ever so slightly, now.
I watched the sorcerer’s face as I talked.</p>

<p>It was still a blank; you could no more
have read it than you could read a stone
wall. Mo replied to my address that he
had been making magic all day and was
tired. Another day, he said, he would
show us some. Tonight we could give him
that tobacco and salt he saw, and he would
think and prepare himself. Magic, he
explained, took much preparation.</p>

<p>I did not care for the whole thing—a
nigger is a nigger to me, and I can’t stand
seeing them put on airs. Besides, I do not
believe in their nonsense. But the Marquis
did, and he was very anxious to see something;
so I swallowed my own feelings and
told Mo we should be glad to see his performance
tomorrow, if that would suit him,
and in the meantime he might have the
tobacco—not the salt: that would come
when he had done something to earn it.
Salt is precious in the interior of New
Guinea, and I was not minded to throw any
of it away.</p>

<p>The Marquis was almost ready to cry—he
had been looking forward to an immediate
satisfaction of his curiosity, and he
was like a child when disappointed.</p>

<p>“Ask him something,” he demanded.
“Ask him at least what it is that he has in
his bamboo, and why he carries a human
hand round his neck, and what is in that
string bag of his. Not to hear anything
tonight, my Flint, that would indeed be
the long lane that breaks the camel’s back.
I’m not made of patience!”</p>

<p>“That’s right; you’re not,” said I. “Well,
Koppi Koko, ask him.”</p>

<p>But here our interpreter went on strike.
He was “too much fright,” he declared.
He would not ask Mo what was in the
bamboo, or about the hand, or anything
else. It struck me that he already knew,
since he came from the coast, only a few
days away. But if he did, he would not
tell.</p>

<p>“You need not worry,” I said to the
Marquis. “I know all that’s in his old
bag without looking. I’ve seen other
sorcerers’ bags. There’ll be a lot of trash
like lizards’ tails and bats’ wings, and
frogs’ feet, and there’ll be queer-shaped
stones he has picked up, and bits of carved
wood, and dried leaves and plants, and
there’s sure to be some quartz crystals—that’s
great magic, with them—and there’ll
very likely be a dagger made of human bone,
and a native fork or two, and a betel-chewing
outfit—poker-worked gourd, with a
boar-tooth stopper, nuts, nice little spatula
with carved head. That’s about all.”</p>

<p>“There could be nothing of more interest
in the world,” declared the Marquis.
“Ethnologically, you can see, without
doubt, the connection between the Witches
of Macbeth——”</p>

<p>“Cut it out, Mark,” I said. “You
ought to know by this time that this horse
isn’t yarded with that kind of corn. But
if you don’t feel you can lay your golden
head on your little pillow tonight without
seeing the curio shop, I’ll work it all right.
It only means a handful or two of salt.”</p>

<p>As I said before, I hate spending my salt
when I haven’t got to; but I opened a tin,
took a good handful and offered it to Mo,
pointing at the same time to his bag and
to our eyes. Koppi Koko had disappeared.
I noted the fact, and decided to argue with
him—helped by a bit of lawyer cane—later
on.</p>

<p>The other natives had all cleared out by
this time, and the sound of the dance was
growing. Thud-thud went the feet; gallop-gallop
the drum, like a horse’s hoofs.
The fire was low in the <i>marea</i>, but it cast
up a deep red glow toward the roof, giving
light enough to see the contents of the wonderful
bag, as Mo tumbled them out on
the floor beside us. The salt had been too
much for him; he accepted it eagerly, and
was eating it like sugar, smearing his paint
all to bits, and nearly choking himself as
he sucked it down. These inland natives
hardly ever see salt, and they are as keen
for it as an alligator for fish, once they get
the chance of a little.</p>

<p>Everything that was in the bag the Marquis
handled, weighed, even smelt. I could
tell him about most of the things. I did
not know the Kata-Kata country, but quite
a lot of the charms were familiar enough.
This stone, I said, was meant to make the
yam crops grow. This one was used for
charming down rain. This carved monstrosity,
like a pig that was half a beetle,
probably was a charm for making war.</p>

<p>All the time he was handling and exclaiming
over the trash in the bag, I kept
a lookout on the sorcerer’s face. There
was something I did not like in the air;
the fact that I could not define it made it
none the less real. It had to do, maybe,
with the wooden demeanor of Mo—or with
the disappearance of all the other men
from the <i>marea</i>—or with a certain strange
pitiful whimpering that had been going on
under the house for quite a good while—a
dog, perhaps; perhaps not.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I looked at Mo a good deal.
If there was mischief in the village—no
matter of what kind—the sorcerer was
sure to be at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>The drums galloped outside, the dance
went on. The moon climbed over the
motionless tops of the cocoanut palms,
and looked down into the open mouth of
the <i>marea</i>. Half in the moonlight, half in
the firelight, Mo’s face grew suddenly dark:
he made a snatch at something that the
Marquis was examining and hid it away—where,
I could not see.</p>

<p>It was a trifling object, only a piece cut
out of one of the plaited red and yellow
belts that nearly every one in the village
wore, men, women, and older children.
The Marquis had been handling it rather
closely, to examine the pattern. A smile
crept over the sorcerer’s face when it was
gone—a cunning, ugly smile, worse than
the stony inexpressiveness that had gone
before. I saw he was bent on making us
forget that scrap of plaited stuff. He
pulled out a lot of other things from the
bag—fossils, beaks, bats’ wings, lumps of
quartz crystal that glittered in the moon—and
began showing them off.</p>

<p>More: by the sound of a certain word I
had heard Koppi Koko use, I understood
him to say that he was ready to do some
magic for us, if we liked. He took down a
cocoanut shell from the wall, and intimated
that it was to be filled with salt first of all.
I filled it, and Mo got up from his crouching
posture on the floor and disappeared,
making signs to show that he would return.</p>

<p>“How do you find that?” asked the Marquis.</p>

<p>“Lucky he had that rag in his collection,”
I said. “He evidently forgot it
was there, didn’t want us to see it, and is
going to do some of his nonsense to put it
out of our heads. It’s a throw-in for us,
Mark.”</p>

<p>“If that signifies a bit of good luck, I
am entirely of accord,” said the Marquis.
“Flint, I am joyous; I must dance.”</p>

<p>And dance he did, lightly as a girl of sixteen,
there in the huge dusk <i>marea</i>, in the
moonlight and the firelight, holding out his
arms like wings, and whistling as he danced.
Before he had done, Mo appeared again
with something in his hand; and for an
instant the stony veil was lifted altogether
from his face, and he shot such a look of
hate at the Marquis that I felt my hand
slip involuntarily round to my hip.</p>

<p>“The old curio dealer doesn’t like your
dancing, Mark,” I warned. “Somehow your
accomplishments don’t seem popular here.”</p>

<p>“It was the dance of Marianne before
Herod,” said the Marquis, stopping at the
end of a pirouette. “I dance that dance
when I am glad. The second part of it, I
mean—the part when Marianne has got
the head of John the Baptist, and is satisfied
of that.”</p>

<p>“Old Ikey Mo isn’t satisfied about something
or other,” I said. “Let’s get him to
work; perhaps he’ll forget his troubles
then.”</p>

<p>“What has he got in his hand?” asked
the Marquis, with interest.</p>

<p>It was a lizard, about ten inches long,
yellowish in color and quite dead. He
gave it to us to handle. We both saw that
it was dead and beginning to grow stiff;
it seemed to have died naturally, as there
were no marks upon it. Mo squatted down
on the floor and motioned us to keep quiet.
He laid the lizard out upon a banana-leaf,
shut his eyes and began to chant something
in a low, monotonous voice. We could not
hear very clearly, for the drums throbbed
on and on in the village and the distant
dance had risen to a thundering chorus of
feet and voices, like the beat of the tradewind
surf on the long beaches of Papua.</p>

<p>By and by he stopped, opened his eyes
and took something out of his bag. The
dance still thundered on; through all its
far-off roar we could hear the dog that
cried under the house—if it was a dog.</p>

<p>Mo had taken a crystal out of his bag—the
biggest one—and unwrapped it from
its covering of leaves. It was a pretty
thing, like the end off a chandelier luster,
and just about the same size, only it was
double-ended, with two points. The lizard
lay still and dead upon the ground. Mo
pointed the crystal at it and began stroking
the air just above the little corpse,
without actually touching it. Over and
over it he went with the crystal, making
lines of light as the dying fire caught the
quartz and drew violet and green and
crimson colors out of it.</p>

<p>He was breathing very hard all the time
and sweat was pouring off his naked body.
One could see that he was making a tremendous
effort, but where, or how, one
could not understand.</p>

<p>At last he stopped, laid the crystal down
on the banana-leaf and looked intently at
the lizard. We looked too.</p>

<p>I know that no one will believe what
happened next, but I must tell the thing as
it occurred. The lizard moved.</p>

<p>We watched it, holding our breath. It
moved again. It drew its legs under it.</p>

<p>The sorcerer took the crystal up and
drew more lines in the air, breathing hard
and narrowing down his eyes till they were
two black sparks beneath his beetling eyebrows.</p>

<p>The lizard got up, staggered and walked
away. It was alive.</p>

<p>I never wished I knew French until that
minute. It would have been something to
understand the expletives that the Marquis
was pouring out in a sharp, rattling, musketry
fire of amazed profanity and delight.
I said a thing or two myself, but it sounded
meek and mild by comparison. And he
did not stop for a good three minutes.
Then he got up—the sorcerer was standing
now—and seized the greasy savage in his
arms, rocking him about as if he were a
child.</p>

<p>“I have found it—the true occult power—genuine
article, all-wool and a yard wide—my
God, yes!” he exclaimed. In his
excitement he was going to our stores to
give the sorcerer I don’t know what or how
much of our invaluable food, but I stopped
him in time.</p>

<p>“Don’t do it, Marky,” I said. “Never
let these brutes know how much you have,
or they’ll loot you, first chance. You’ve
given him quite enough. I allow it’s wonderful,
but there may be some very simple
explanation after all.”</p>

<p>“You do not understand,” said the Marquis.
“You have no faith. Let me look
yet again at the crystal. It is of course
but an instrument of the power—still——”</p>

<p>He took it in his hands, and began
examining it. Mo kept a close watch on it,
hovering over us like a hen over her chickens
when a hawk is about. It was plain that
he valued his charm quite a good deal.</p>

<p>“The finest crystal I ever saw, with any
one of these sorcerers,” I declared, handling
it....</p>

<p>I don’t know how the idea came into my
head, but it did come, like a shock from a
battery—just about as hard and as quick.
And what was queer, it came into the Marquis’
head at exactly the same moment.
For just as my hand made a sudden clutch
at the crystal, his hand met it and the
two hands closed on each other. Our eyes
met, and if mine were as glaring and excited
as <span class="lock">his——</span></p>

<p>I think they must have been. Mo had
the thing out of our two hands before we
knew where we were. It was gone, back
in the bag like a conjuring trick, and the
stony veil had fallen before the sorcerer’s
face again.</p>

<p>We were both breathing hard, like men
who have run a race, but I think we kept
pretty cool. It was the Marquis who begged
then, by signs, to see the crystal again,
and succeeded in getting Mo to show the
end of it, shining out of the green wrapping
of fresh banana-leaf, between the string
meshes of the bag. But it was I who
pulled my watch out and got the face of
it up against the point of the crystal—all
of it that Mo would let us touch now.
The sharp end of the thing scored into the
glass of it as if it had been butter.</p>

<p>What the Marquis said that time I have
always wanted to know—it sounded much
livelier than the last. I cut him short
with a kick.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, keep cool,” I said.
“Don’t let him suspect anything; it’s our
only chance. You don’t know how they
value those charms of theirs—it’s no question
of buying.... Come away and leave
him alone. Don’t let him think we care
about it.”</p>

<p>I almost dragged him away. It was
deliciously cool and fresh in the moon outside;
there was a smell of coming rain, and
the wind brought whiffs of pawpaw
blossom from somewhere in the forest,
heavy and treacly-sweet. The noise of
the dance was dying down: it was almost
quiet.</p>

<p>Under the <i>marea</i>, in the space among the
piles, that doglike whimper went on. But
the Marquis and I were too excited to
notice it. Afterward, I remembered how
we had heard it.</p>

<p>“It’s bigger than the Kohinoor, but not
near so big as the Cullinan,” I said, when
we were out of earshot.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, it is a king’s fortune,”
affirmed the Marquis. He was quite pale,
and almost trembling. “And this sorcerer
is using it to make charms!”</p>

<p>“If we can get it—” I began.</p>

<p>“Where shall there be any difficulty? It
is only to buy.”</p>

<p>“Is it? You don’t know these sorcerers.
Probably he thinks his whole power depends
on it.”</p>

<p>“Flint, my Flint, it would be hard to say
what it depends on. He has power, we
know it. He has power of life and death.
What a man!”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s only a greasy nigger after all,
whatever conjuring tricks he can play,” I
said irritably. “They claim a lot, these
sorcerers. They say they can kill any one
by wishing, and bring him to life again by
making spells. If you listened to what they
say——”</p>

<p>“But the lizard—he was dead,” said the
Marquis, in a solemn voice.</p>

<p>“Hang the lizard! It’s the diamond we
are after now. First to get it, and then to
find out where it came from—if that’s possible.”</p>

<p>“Flint, my friend, I am not rich—you
know that,” said the Marquis, with something
like tears in his fat voice. “I have
strained myself—have, what is it you say?
bust—have bust my resources, to make
this voyage in New Guinea. But if we can
get that diamond—see, the glories of my
house are restored; I am once more the
proper kind of a marquis, you bet! And
you—you are rich. You are a gentle and
a spiritual, Flint—I shall be glad to think of
you rich.”</p>

<p>All this time we had been making away
from the <i>marea</i>, but the cry under the
house never ceased to follow us. I could
not stand it at last. There are many
things in a New Guinea inland town which
you had better not inquire into unless you
are prepared to put up a fight. But somehow
I felt I wanted to look into this, and
I told the Marquis so.</p>

<p>“Is it not a dog?” he asked, surprised.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it is,” I said. “Anyhow,
give me your box of matches and we’ll go
back and see. It gets me, somehow.”</p>

<p>The <i>marea</i> was dark and empty when we
returned; the sorcerer was gone. The
dance was taking new life—it roared like
a forest fire, down there at the end of the
village. There was not a soul in sight
as we got under the <i>marea</i> and struck our
matches to look.</p>

<p>It was not a dog. It was the girl who
had been so fascinated with the Marquis’
dancing a few hours earlier. She was
crouching on the ground like a sick monkey,
her head on her knees, moaning in a
cold, frightened sort of way as if she did
not expect that any one would hear or heed.</p>

<p>“Hold! the little beautiful!” cried the
Marquis. I got him by the slack of his
trousers just in time. He was springing
forward to catch her in his arms and console
her—a kind and a manly impulse, no
doubt, but one that, I judged, might cost
the little creature dear.</p>

<p>She did not even notice him. She went
on softly wailing like a thing that was
doomed to die and knew and feared it.
In one slight brown hand she held something
that was half wrapped round her
waist, half torn loose. I struck another
match and looked at it. It was a red and
yellow waist-belt, with a piece cut out.
The gap was just about the size of the piece
of red-and-yellow stuff we had seen in the
sorcerer’s bag.</p>

<p>She would not listen when we spoke to
her; she only drew away and shivered. I
judged it best to leave her, for the present
at all events. We crept along under the
piles, walking half doubled up, till we were
out in the moonlight once more. The street
was still quiet, but the ugly little man with
the bat-like ears, who had been so angry
earlier in the evening, was coming up toward
the house. He seemed to hear the crying:
he turned half round as he passed, and
shook his spear at the <i>marea</i>, glaring at the
little, crouching shadow below.</p>

<p>Then he looked at us and deliberately
spat toward the Marquis; turned, went on
and entered another house.</p>

<p>“That throws some light,” I said.
“Mark, I reckon that the girl has been too
much struck with that beautiful performance
of yours, and that the ugly little man
is her lover and doesn’t like it. I rather
think he has complained to his brother,
Mo, and got him to puri-puri her, and she’s
half mad with fright.”</p>

<p>“What is puri-puri?” asked the Marquis,
looking grave.</p>

<p>“They’ve another word here. All over
Papua, mostly, it means the same—sorcery.
He’s got a bit of her waist-belt to make a
spell of, and she thinks she’s going to die in
consequence. Of course she won’t, but
she’s badly scared.”</p>

<p>“Flint, he has the power of life and death—that
man,” said the Marquis. “What
can we do?”</p>

<p>“Rats, he hasn’t power of life and death!”
I said. “We can give him a talking to and
keep him from scaring the poor little soul
any more, or she might really die of fright.
Don’t go talking to her—it would only
make things worse.”</p>

<p>“The first thing in the morning we must
talk to him, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“First thing. We might as well have our
tent, Marky; I think it would be more
healthy than the <i>marea</i>, somehow.”</p>

<p>We had, and slept in it—part of the night.
About the small chill hour that comes near
dawn we were roused out by a wild crying
from one of the houses near at hand—a
house into which we had seen the little
maiden creep, still sobbing, before we
turned in ourselves, for, needless to say, the
Marquis and I had been keeping as much
of a lookout over her as we could. But this
was not the girl’s crying; it was horrified
yells from the other inmates of the house—yells
of such dismay that we wasted no time
in catching up our arms and running in.</p>

<p>The house was nothing but a brown
thatch roof set on a sago-palm floor. It
was dimly lighted by a fire; in the short
interval before I could get my hurricane
lantern alight I saw a dozen or two brown
naked forms, moving about distractedly,
and howling. Something was visible on
the floor among their feet.</p>

<p>I got the lantern alight, and held it up.
There lay the pretty little girl, dead and
stiff. She had not a wound or a mark on
her, but she seemed to have been cold for
hours. Probably the growing chill of her
small body was what had attracted the
attention of her companions.</p>

<p>“Flint, my friend, she is dead, the little
beautiful, and I have been her murderer,
by gum!” said the Marquis, in a low,
shocked whisper.</p>

<p>“You haven’t anything of the kind,
Mark; don’t be morbid.... Poor little
girl!” I said, looking at her again, as the
women, howling loudly, picked her up and
carried her away.</p>

<p>“Life and death—life and death!” said
the Marquis. “Flint, we are in deep water.”</p>

<p>“If it’s only water, we’re lucky,” I said,
leading the way out of the house again.
“Sentries after this, Mark. I take no
chances.”</p>

<p>The Marquis was looking at the <i>marea</i>,
where the sorcerer, no doubt, was coolly
sleeping.</p>

<p>“Blood—blood!” he said. “Always,
where there is a great diamond, there shall
be blood. The stone is blooded now, my
Flint. When will be the next?”</p>

THE JUMPING BAMBOO<br>
</h4>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">To</span> enter an unknown, hostile town in
the heart of New Guinea—to have
trouble over a village beauty, see a
sorcerer restore the dead to life, discover a
huge diamond, and be involved in a sudden
death—all within twenty-four hours—is
adventure enough for any one. Enough
even for the Marquis.</p>

<p>It was more than enough for me—I do
not go out looking for adventures, any more
than I suppose a confectioner’s boy would
go out looking for cakes; and for the same
reason—I am sick of them. I go looking for
gold, as a rule; sometimes I find it, and
sometimes I don’t. If I do, I can have a
good time with it in Sydney or Melbourne;
if I didn’t, I can look again. But I never
saw the adventure that you could pay in
over the counter of a bar, or at the box-office
of a theater. Adventures are a
nuisance and a hindrance, so far as I have
experienced them; and as to going out
actually hunting for <span class="lock">them——</span></p>

<p>Well, that was very much what the Marquis
was doing. I will say this much for
him—he wasn’t any sort of a coward. I
have seen him cry like a girl; I have seen
him shiver with excitement, but I never saw
him frightened, and I never saw him give
anything the best of it. That would have
kept me in his company, even if the big
diamond had not.</p>

<p>But now we were inevitably linked by
that double interest. It shows what a good
sort the Marquis was, that we hadn’t a
word’s dispute as to who found it first,
or whose was the right to claim it—if
we ever got it. We just assumed that,
being in the thing together, it was “halves.”
I was to stick to the Marquis, and he to me,
till the business was through.</p>

<p>Good Lord! if we had had an idea of
how much that meant!...</p>

<p>We were beginning to have an inkling,
no more, the morning after the poor little
pretty girl had been buried. They carried
her away, wrapped in mats, to some burial
place in the forest as soon as the daylight
broke, and we did not get a chance to examine
the corpse, as I had wished to do. That
hurried look-over in her own house, when we
found her dead, had shown me that there
was no obvious trace of injury; but I
thought her slightly swollen. I suspected
poison—the sorcerers of New Guinea are
clever poisoners, and very ready to use
their powers. But nothing would ever tell
us now.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances I would
have cleared out of the town straight away,
for I knew well that some kind of trouble
was sure to follow such an unlucky introduction.
But with a diamond the size of a
chandelier-luster knocking about in a sorcerer’s
bag, within a few yards of us, we
were not likely to move on in a hurry.</p>

<p>The Marquis and I, on the morning
following that eventful night, held a council
of war in front of our tent where we
could see all that went on in the village
street, and keep an eye on the whereabouts
of Mo. So long as we saw him, we knew
that he could not be doing much mischief.</p>

<p>The bat-eared little man was not to be
seen that day. (I had ascertained through
Koppi Koko that the dead girl was his
promised wife, and that she had told him,
after watching the Marquis dance, that she
never would marry an ugly little thing like
him.) He was the sorcerer’s youngest and
favorite brother, so the useful Koppi Koko
had found out—being very anxious to
retrieve his character, and save himself
the hammering that he feared his desertion
might bring down on him. I did not touch
him as it happened, not because I thought
he didn’t deserve it, but because I knew
he would be more useful if he were kept in
suspense.</p>

<p>I thought his information interesting,
but by no means reassuring. It was too
much to suppose that the matter would be
allowed to end there. The little man must
have developed a worse grudge against us
than against his late unlucky fiancée, and
if her fate was an example of what we had
got to expect, things were looking lively.</p>

<p>So I told the Marquis. We were sitting
on the ground outside our tent and watching
the villagers moving about their daily
tasks—water-carrying, net-making, wood-cutting,
fetching sago from the forest, going
out to dig yams, or to hunt pig. They
looked peaceable enough, and it was a
peaceful, pretty scene, with the sun just
rising over the tall green palms and the
smoke curling thin and blue from under the
deep thatch roofs.</p>

<p>But the old hand in New Guinea knows
well—too well—that the Papuan is most
dangerous when, apparently, most friendly.
The quiet aspect of the place meant nothing—or
worse.</p>

<p>“There is a feeling of sadness upon me
this morning; I have the blooming hump,”
said the Marquis, his fat chin resting upon
his pink fat hand. “If you offered me the—the
big diamond itself—in payment, I
could not dance a step.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. I reckon you’d better
keep on feeling that way as long as you
can,” I said. “We’ve trouble enough on
our hands without making any more, and
your accomplishments do seem to bring
the thunder about one’s ears, somehow.
Mark, let’s talk it all out.”</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” said the Marquis, turning
his full-moon face round upon me.</p>

<p>“Look here. We’ve got to get that diamond.
And we’ve got to avoid being poisoned,
as the girl was. And we’ve got to
get our carriers out safe with ourselves, and
be on our way to the coast inside of a day
or so at the most: it isn’t healthy to stop
here too long.”</p>

<p>“Perfectly. That’s right.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I reckon the sorcerer’s not
going to go on keeping the diamond where
he did, because a blind baby could have
seen that we wanted it. We must get some
idea of likely hiding-places——”</p>

<p>“Hold a minute. Could we not buy it,
quite simply?”</p>

<p>“No, Mark; I’ve tried.”</p>

<p>“Already?”</p>

<p>“This morning, while you were choosing
between your heliotrope shirt with the
green tie, and your pink one with the blue,
I went and had a talk with the brute—I’d
rather have pounded him to a jelly, but you
can’t always do the thing you ought to do,
up-country in Papua. Told him we had a
fancy for his magic crystal; said you were
a bit of a sorcerer yourself, and would give
a lot for it; offered all it was safe to offer.
No go; he didn’t rise to it worth twopence.
You see, if I had shown him all we had, he
would simply have looted our stores and had
us knocked on the head—or tried to—and
anything I offered didn’t tempt him, in
comparison with the stone. We have pretty
short tucker, you know, Mark—I’m not
blaming you, for I know you couldn’t afford
a big outfit, but there it is: we can’t bid
high even if it was safe to show everything.”</p>

<p>“But, see then!” exclaimed the Marquis.
“Could we not promise him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you could promise him anything,
but he wouldn’t believe you. They never
keep promises themselves, and can’t understand
any one else doing it. And I put it
to you: Would even a white man part with
something he valued quite a lot, to a couple
of strangers, just on a promise?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the Marquis thoughtfully.
“Assuredly he would say that a bird in the
bush blows nobody good, and laugh in your
nose at you.”</p>

<p>“Well, what I propose to do is just to
take the diamond any way we can get it—steal
it, if you like to say so—and when we
get back to Port Moresby, send him a big
equivalent for it—a case of valuable goods
of some kind or other. That would be
treating him as fairly as we can. Anyhow,
there is one thing we aren’t going to do,
Marky, and that is, leave a chunk of a rough
diamond you could break a man’s head with
knocking loose about Kata-Kata in a sorcerer’s
bag.”</p>

<p>“I am all of accord with you—no blooming
fear!” said the Marquis. “But, Flint,
there is one thing that I must not forget,
even on account of the diamond—my seek
for the occult. Can we not get this Mo to
show us more things of his magic?”</p>

<p>“If Mo doesn’t intend to show you more
of his ‘magic’ without being asked or
wanted, you may call me a yellow Chow,”
I said. “Don’t you worry about that;
you’ll get all you want, I reckon.”</p>

<p>We had left the tent now, as it was
growing very hot in the village, and we
were walking along the bank of the river
that ran close beside the street. It was a
pretty river, shallow and foamy, and full
of big rocks covered with moss and fern.
Here and there you could see a pink or
purple orchid, and the cocoanuts cast wonderful
shadows on the pools.</p>

<p>Just where the shadow was deepest and
coolest something stirred in the brown of the
water—something that was brown itself and
that glittered with wet. It was Mo, bathing.</p>

<p>I pulled the Marquis back into the shade.
“This is luck!” I whispered. “The village
is quiet; we can very likely get into Mo’s
own house, and have a look round. Come
on as quick as you can.”</p>

<p>... How still the wide brown street
was, under the terrible mid-day sun! Noon
is the lonely hour in Papua, when the heat
is at its worst; no man stirs about who is
not compelled to do so. The women were
in the yam fields, taking their mid-day rest
from toil beneath the shelter of the bush.
The men were loafing about somewhere in
the depths of the forest, pretending to hunt.
In the town itself there were only a few
old people and children, all asleep. The
main street was a river of white fire; the
shadows beneath the long-legged houses
were like pools of tar. Not a dog stirred
out from shelter. Not a footstep rustled
or a palm-sheath floor gave forth a creak.
It was undoubtedly the moment.</p>

<p>We knew where Mo’s house was—a fine
building with a high-gabled roof, and an
extraordinary amount of ornament in the
way of carved birds and crocodiles, and
fringes of waving fiber. We scuttled up the
ladder silently and swiftly, like two thieves,
and dodged in under the low door. Inside,
the house was high and cool and empty. A
pleasant amber light filtered down from
somewhere in the lofty roof; but there were
no windows, and the door was buried in the
overhanging thatch. Straining our eyes,
we looked about us.... Mats, wooden
sleeping-pillows shaped like alligators; lime
gourds carved and poker-worked; tall
shields with devilish faces carved upon
them; a string of human skulls, extending
from the gable to the floor; a dagger carved
from a thigh-bone; dancing-masks made in
the semblance of sharks and birds and
kangaroos; arrows; pineapple-shaped stone
clubs; long, barked, ebony spears....</p>

<p>In one corner hung the sorcerer’s great
feather bonnet, taken off for bathing; his
ugly human-hand locket was tidily laid
away on a rafter. The thick bamboo that
we had seen him carrying like a wand lay
on the floor—tightly corked up. But what
interested us more than anything was the
big charm-bag, hung on the wall, and bursting
full.</p>

<p>We had it down in a moment, and tumbled
the things out on the floor, tossing
them recklessly here and there, in the
search for our wonderful stone. I took the
opportunity of looking at all the quartz
crystals it contained—there were a good
many—and opening all the little banana-leaf
parcels, hoping to find another diamond
in the absence of our first discovery, which
(I saw almost at once) was not there. But
there was nothing.</p>

<p>This did not surprise me much, for Koppi
Koko had told me (under pressure of certain
threats) that the crystal, which was
well known to all the natives, had been the
property of innumerable sorcerers from
time to time, and had, in all probability,
passed about over half Papua. Nothing
could be more impossible, in that country
of Babel-dialects, than to find out where
the stone had originally come from. However,
if we could only get hold of it, I was
not bothering much about anything else.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said the Marquis,
drawing himself erect and kicking aside the
bag with his foot, “that our friend, Monsieur
Mo, is not such a fool as he glitters.”</p>

 <p class="hanging caption">I have never been called a nervous man; but I was down the
ladder and out in the street almost before the Marquis</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>“That’s right,” I answered, looking round
again. Rolled-up mats?—gourds?—clay
water-pots? Impossible to say. At all
events, we <span class="lock">might——</span></p>

<p>“My God, Flint!” said the Marquis, in a
low, horrified voice. “My God of Gods,
look at that!”</p>

<p>The flimsy flooring shook as he bounded
back toward the door. I jumped back
with him—and then looked.</p>

<p>The bamboo was rolling about on the
floor, and trying to stand on its end!</p>

<p>We stood with our backs against the
thatch by the door, breathing very hard,
and staring still harder. The thing kept
on jumping and rolling. It was rolling
toward us.</p>

<p>I have never been called a nervous man;
but I was down the ladder and out in the
street almost before the Marquis. It has
always seemed to me a special Providence
that we did not meet, and stick, in the
door.</p>

<p>We were scarcely out, and beginning to
feel a little foolish—I, for one, had made up
my mind already to go back and investigate
the thing, sorcery, trick, or whatever
it was—when we saw the tall, wet figure of
Mo coming up through the trees from the
river. It did not seem a happy time to
continue our investigations, so we made for
the tent, trying to look as if we had only
been out for a stroll, and (I dare say) succeeding
just about as well as a couple of
small boys caught coming away from the
fruit garden.</p>

<p>“No go,” I said, flinging myself down on
the pile of sacks inside our tent. “Mark,
we’ll have a smoke and a game of cards,
and then we’ll go to sleep.”</p>

<p>“What for, to sleep?” asked the Marquis.</p>

<p>“Because I don’t propose to sleep much
tonight—nor will you. It seems to me
that things are given to happening here at
night, and I intend to keep a look-out
instead.”</p>

<p>“We will sleep, then,” agreed my companion.
And we did, after our smoke and
our game—all through the burning afternoon,
until the sun began to drop behind
the cocoanuts, and the leather-necks commenced
their evening squawking and squabbling,
and the smoke of supper fires stole
out, smelling pleasant and peaceful and
homey and everything that it particularly
was not—here in the heart of cannibal
Papua, in the sorcerer’s town.</p>

<p>When we woke up we were thoroughly
rested, for we had slept long and deep, after
our broken rest the night before. I called
up Koppi Koko, and bade him get the
supper ready. The Marquis yawned,
stretched, and sat up on his mat.</p>

<p>“Hallo!” I said. “There’s another of
your singlets going; you won’t have enough
clothes to carry you back to Port Moresby,
at this rate.” For the Marquis, being big
and fat, stretched his clothes terribly, and,
in consequence, they were wearing very fast.</p>

<p>“I do feel like a cool window in my
back; have a look, kindly,” he said, trying
to see over his own shoulder.</p>

<p>I looked at his back. “Mark,” I said,
“take off your singlet and look at it. I
don’t like this.”</p>

<p>I had to peel him out of it, for it had
shrunk and was tight. When he was clear,
and had the garment on his knee, he gave
it one glance and then looked at me.</p>

<p>“My friend, as I said yesterday, we are
in deep waters,” he remarked. “This,
while I lay asleep, has been cut. This cut,
it has taken out a piece, and the piece is
the same size as——”</p>

<p>“As the piece out of the girl’s belt,” I
finished.</p>

<p>We looked at each other; the leather-necks
squawked outside; the dogs of the
village began that peculiarly mournful,
wolf-like howling that native dogs always
do set up about sunset.</p>

<p>“And the girl, the little beautiful, that
night she died,” observed the Marquis. He
whistled softly to himself: an air I did not
know—a crying, sobbing sort of tune it
was, and not calculated to raise any one’s
spirits if they had needed it—which
I should have thought the Marquis’
might.</p>

<p>“See, I will dance her requiem,” he said.
“Perhaps my own, good Flint. One never
knows.”</p>

<p>Singing the air gently to himself—I can
not describe how mournful and calling-you-to-come-back
it sounded, or how the horrid
wailing of the native dogs chimed in and
became a part—he danced, in the twelve-by-fourteen
space of the tent.... I have
seen something like it in the Islands, when
the warriors were dancing for the funeral of
a great dead chief—something, but not so
good. It was grief, and death, and despair
put into motion, and translated, by the
Marquis’ huge limbs, into a language that
even the Papuans themselves would have
understood. All, too, as lightly as—as—well,
as the feathers waving in the wind
upon a hearse.</p>

<p>When he had done he sat down, and
smiles broke out all over his pink, fat face.</p>

<p>“Good, eh?” he said. “That was a
funeral dance of prehistoric Crete, that I
found among the buried carvings of the
palace of Minos, which they have
lately——”</p>

<p>“Come back,” I said. “This isn’t
ancient Crete, it’s modern New Guinea,
and we’re in a hole. Mark, I propose, for
tonight, that we let on to go to sleep, but
don’t—and then we’ll see what happens.
As for supper, I’m going out to cook that
myself. I’m not taking any chances just
now.”</p>

<p>“As you wish,” said the Marquis. “But
you can not deny that it is all most interesting.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very—damned—interesting,” I said.
“I hope it doesn’t get any more so. I’d
like a little boredom for a change, if you
ask me.” And I went to cook the supper—not
that I thought it really necessary,
but just—in case. One does a lot of things
for that reason, in the queer places of
Papua.</p>

<p>We had a little coffee in our stores, and I
brewed a billy-can full, for I did not want
any mistakes made about going to sleep.
At the usual hour we put out our light and
lay down on the rough sack-beds I had
fixed up. The Marquis and I were near
enough together to touch each other if we
wished. We turned in all standing, even to
our boots. The carriers were camped in a
little hut close by; our stores were mostly
piled up in the tent, and we had our
revolvers strapped round our waists.</p>

<p>It was arranged that we were to take
watch and watch about, for two hours
each, and that the man on watch should
sit on his bed, not lie. I could guess the
time easily enough, and the Marquis
thought he could also. In any case, there
should be no striking of matches.</p>

<p>The night wore on but slowly. At first
there were constant stirrings in the village—talking,
squabbling, moving here and
there; then the dogs began to fight; then
some of the roosters waked up and crowed,
and roused out the rest a good many hours
too soon. But by degrees the town settled
to rest. I had taken the first watch; had
lain down—not to sleep—through the Marquis’;
and now my second watch was well
on its way.</p>

<p>After a time it grew so still that the
silence seemed to tingle, in the way it does
when you are awake at night and listening.
There was not a breath of wind, no moon,
and few stars; the weather had been heavy
and thunderous all day, and the sky was
clouded. In the triangle made by the
opening of the tent I could see—when I had
been straining my eyes into the dark for quite
a long time—the dim grayness of the village
street, and the black bank of palms beyond.</p>

<p>I say there was not a sound, nor anything
to see. Seated there on my rough
bed, every sense alert, I might have been
alone at the end of the world, with the last
man dead beside me.</p>

<p>But it came to me, not suddenly, quietly
and surely, that we were not alone. I do
not know whence the first warning conveyed
itself; it came, however, and I found
myself listening and looking expectantly,
with a certainty in my mind that something
was going to happen.</p>

<p>Sight and hearing are not the only senses
that a bushman can use to good effect. I
smelt, cautiously and without noise.</p>

<p>There was the marshy odor of the river
behind the palms. There was the indescribable
smell of a native village—dry,
sun-baked earth, insanitary whiffs of decaying
stuff, the hay-like odor of old thatch.
And something more—the smell of cocoanut-oil
warm and fresh, and very near.</p>

<p>I remembered that the Papuan always
oils himself after bathing. I recollected
having seen Mo in the river.</p>

<p>Very cautiously I stretched out and
touched the Marquis’ hand. He was
awake—he was not the kind of man to
sleep when he ought to have been waking,
for all his flummery—and his hand met
mine with a squeeze. We listened hard.
There was not the ghost of a sound, but
the smell grew stronger, passed, and died
away. And, just after, the faintest possible
shadow crossed the gray of the road.</p>

<p>We listened again, and I for one did not
like it, for I knew that whatever Mo had
meant to do was done. Then, suddenly,
the Marquis’ hand caught hold of mine in
a grip that was painful.</p>

<p>“Flint, a light!” was all he said. I had
my matches in my hand, and I struck one
almost before he had done speaking. The
Marquis was sitting up on his bed, looking
white and drawn.</p>

<p>“It is the ‘touch of death,’” he said.
“I have felt it—cold as—as nothing but
death is cold.” He sat like a statue; his
hand had let mine go and was gripping
tight to the edge of the bed. I was up in
a moment, and looking all round the tent.
There was not a thing to be seen. Having
searched, I put out the light again and
waited. It is not a good thing to make
yourself a target for possible arrows shot
in the dark. I could hear the Marquis
breathing heavily.</p>

<p>Then, in a moment, he gave a terrible
cry, leaped right on to my bed, and brought
it and me and himself down to the earth
together in one tremendous crash.</p>

<p>There was no use trying to “lie low”
after that. I struggled out somehow, lit
the hurricane lamp, and asked the Marquis,
who was sitting half-dazed in the midst of
the ruins, what he supposed had happened.</p>

<p>He was still deadly pale.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, my Flint,” he answered,
looking at me with the fixed expression of
a man who has had a shock. “I know
only that the hand of death itself was laid
upon me, there in the dark—first it has
touched my arm, and then my heart where
my clothes were open for the heat.”</p>

<p>“How do you know it was the hand of
death?” I asked, getting a bottle of whisky
out of one of our swags. “How do you
know you weren’t asleep after all, and
having a bad dream?”</p>

<p>“I was not asleep; you will remember
I clasped your hand. And that thing
was death, I know, because in these plains
where it is all the time hot there is nothing
cold at all, and that which has touched
me was the cold of death.”</p>

<p>“Rats! You aren’t dead. Have some
whisky,” I said, pouring it out.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am escaped; that’s what I don’t
comprehend,” said the Marquis thoughtfully.
“That is good whisky; that warms
the muscles of the heart. Flint—” with
a sudden revival— “you can not but must
allow, this is the very devil interesting!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We were rather sleepy in the morning,
I remember—the effect of the coffee having
worn off. I had an idea or two as to what
course we had best follow for the capturing
of the stone; but nothing could be
done before midday. So I and the Marquis
kept watch for each other to sleep, and
we got in a good three hours apiece before
noon.</p>

<p>When the white blaze of twelve o’clock
was searing the palms once more, and
the village folk were away or asleep, and
Mo had gone down to the river again to
bathe, I beckoned the Marquis out. We
wore the rubber-soled shoes that one uses
for easy bush-walking, and made not a
sound as we passed along the street. The
shadows of the palms were ink upon white
paper; the dogs slept beneath the houses;
the tame cockatoos and parrots drowsed
upon the eaves. The heat was awful:
it seemed as though the village in its stillness
lay dead beneath a torrent of white
fire from the implacable sky.</p>

<p>We gained the sorcerer’s house without
being seen and slipped into the cool interior,
gasping like creatures that find water
after drought.</p>

<p>“What a day!” choked the Marquis, in
a whisper—we feared, somehow, to talk
aloud. “You may have thankfulness that
you are as lean as a herring, Flint. If
you had my weight——”</p>

<p>He sat down on the floor to cool off—and
it promptly gave way beneath him.
I hauled him out with some trouble, and
set him in a safe place.</p>

<p>“I believe that’s a trap-door,” I said,
looking at it. “Seems to be meant for a
hurried get-away in case of trouble. Not
a bad idea. I wonder how he came to
leave it open.”</p>

<p>We looked about us. The bamboo that
had given us such an unpleasant start on
the day before was nowhere to be seen.
Otherwise the house was the same. Still—whether
it was the effect of the alarm in
the night, or simply the discouragement
that always treads close on the heels of
excited hope—I did not feel that we were
nearer our goal. Rather, I felt farther
away.</p>

<p>“We must look,” said the Marquis, who
evidently did not share my discouragement.
“You will look one side of the
house, I will look the other, and before
Mo will come back——”</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence, for up
the long ladder leading to the door (Mo’s
house was the highest in the village) came,
at that moment, a slowly creaking step.</p>

<p>With one consent we dived through the
trap-door and pulled it flat after us. Then
we halted under the house, listening and
looking eagerly.</p>

<p>“If he doesn’t see us—” I whispered.</p>

<p>“I think he can not,” answered the
Marquis, cautiously. “But we can see
him through these cracks—What chance!
What chance!”</p>

<p>... It is long ago now, but to this day
I am vexed when I think how easily the
greasy old villain took us in—how readily
we dropped into his snare. That Mo had
been perfectly aware of our visit the day
before, that he guessed we would come
again, had returned early in order to
hurry us out, had left the trap-door open
in order that we might go through it and
watch him underneath the house—had
indeed planned the whole thing from start
to finish—never occurred to either of us
at the time, though, indeed, we might
have guessed that the chief sorcerer of
the chief town of sorcery-riddled Kata-Kata
was not likely to be quite so simple
as he seemed.</p>

<p>At any rate, there we stood in the dark
under the house, looking breathlessly
through the cracks in the floor, and watching
Mo. And Mo knew it, little as we
thought it.</p>

<p>First of all, he took the long bamboo off
his breast—it had accompanied him to the
river today, seemingly—uncorked the top,
and looked cautiously in. We could not
see what was inside. He put his palm
over the opening, and with the other hand
drew toward him one of the large clay
water-pots standing on the floor. These
water-pots narrowed to a mouth about
four inches across; some of them had
baked-clay lids on the top. He chose one
that had a lid, uncovered it, and dropped
something in.</p>

<p>Where had he produced it from? The
man was like a conjurer. I had not seen
anything in his hand a moment before—but
it was undoubtedly the great diamond
that he dropped into the jar. I even
heard it tinkle against the hard clay bottom
as it fell. The Marquis, in his excitement,
pinched my arm so hard that it was
black and blue afterward. I knew he was
simply boiling with corked-up speech, and
I wondered how long he could hold on.</p>

<p>Now the sorcerer, after a hurried look
round the empty house (he really was a
splendid actor), removed his palm from
the top of the bamboo, and inverted it
over the jar. We could see by his motions
that he was pouring something from the
one to the other; it seemed to come slowly,
and take some time. When he had
done, he put the clay cover on the jar,
shook the empty bamboo, and threw it
down.</p>

<p>After this he produced a small trade
looking-glass, oiled his hair, put feathers
in it, painted his face, took his bag of
charms off the wall, slung a tall bow on
his shoulder, and whistled to his dog.
It was plain that he was going hunting—probably
courting also, the two occupations
often mixing and overlapping a good
deal in the Papuan forests.</p>

<p>We waited. We waited till Mo and his
dog and his bow and his bag had disappeared
down the village street, pale and
unsubstantial in the glaring overhead sun.
We waited another ten minutes after.
Silence: the village slept beneath the
fiery enchantment of noon; the birds were
voiceless in the forest; the giant leaves
hung still.</p>

<p>“Now!” I said, and we crept back through
the trap-door.</p>

<p>For a moment we stood silent in the
lonely house, the scene of Satan alone knew
what deviltries. The hideous dancing-masks
grinned at us from the walls; the
skulls showed their teeth. The sorcerer’s
bamboo lay on the floor, empty, open,
defying us to solve its mystery. And at
our very feet stood the water-jar, its wide-splayed
mouth covered only by the lid of
baked clay.</p>

<p>Was the prize really in our grasp at last?
I hesitated, stretched out a hand, and took
it back—stopped, listened....</p>

<p>There certainly was a sound somewhere.
It was a familiar sound, and yet I could not
say exactly what it was. It was near and
it was not near. It was—What in the
name of the devil was it?</p>

<p>“See, Flint, I tire of this!” shouted the
Marquis suddenly and imprudently. (I
judge that he had heard it too, and it and
other things had “got on his nerves,” as
women say.) “Faint heart gathers no
moss—here goes for France, my brave!”
He made a dart at the jar and snatched off
the lid.</p>

<p>Do you know what is the swiftest thing
in the animal kingdom? Did you ever see
a brown flash of lightning get up from the
ground and strike?</p>

<p>I know, and I had seen just such a thing
before. So I didn’t have to stop and think....
The Marquis got my punch fair in
the chest; it doubled him up and sent him
half across the house. My right hand
being thus occupied, I hadn’t time to
attend to my left and it got in the way.
It was on the first joint of the third finger
that the snake got me. He held on like
a bulldog.</p>

<p>Now, I must have knocked the wind
pretty well out of the Marquis, in throwing
him out of the way as I did; but you never
saw a man recover quicker. He was up on
his feet before one would have time to tell
of it. He had got a great steel clearing-knife
down from the wall (evidently Mo
did a bit of coastal trading) in two seconds
or thereabouts, and had slashed the snake
clean through before I got it shaken off.
I pulled its head away then and threw it
on the floor. I had had a look at it and
saw that there was only one thing to do.</p>

<p>“Give me the knife,” I said. The Marquis
gave it and, as I am alive, he was crying
as he did.</p>

<p>There was nothing to make a fuss about.
I had the top joint of the finger off in two
clean chops. And there is no finger a man
can spare better than the left-hand third.</p>

<p>I tied it up and put a sort of tourniquet
on. Then I remembered the diamond—it
was not so strange that I’d forgotten it for
a minute or two, all things considered—and
put my right hand into the jar that had
lately held such an unpleasant occupant.
I pulled out—not the diamond, but a bit
of common stone tied up in a leaf.</p>

<p>The sorcerer had us again. No doubt
he had palmed the jewel, somehow or other,
when setting his trap.</p>

<p>I was feeling a bit sick, what with loss of
blood and the small amount of poison that
had got into circulation before I took the
finger off. I was sure now that we had not a
chance of getting the stone—as things were.
Mo was thoroughly awake, and there was
nothing for it but to retreat—for the present.</p>

<p>“Wait till I come back with an R. M.
and a score of armed native constabulary,
you heathen beast,” I said to myself.
“Just wait. You’ve earned what you’ll get—richly
earned it.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to go, Mark,” I said aloud.
“Get the carriers together for me as quick
as you can; it’s the best time, with all the
people away. If we stay on, there’ll be a
row tonight as sure as Fate, and the Government
don’t like unofficial people to do
its killing for it. We’ll come back, and give
them what-for with the chill off. Oh, Lord,
don’t do that!”</p>

<p>For the Marquis was hanging round my
neck—a pretty solid weight—and had already
kissed me loudly on both cheeks.</p>

<p>“My brave retainer!” he said, with tears
in his voice (I reckoned he meant preserver,
but it was all one), “what can I ever do to
recompense you of my life that you have
saved?”</p>

<p>“I told you what to do just now,” I said.
“Get the carriers under way, and sharp.
I want to drink some ammonia.”</p>

<p>I did, and it did me good; I was able to
walk almost as well as usual in half an hour.
I slung my arm up in a long sheaf of grass,
and we set off from the village as hard as we
could, keeping a look-out for ambushes all
the way. But the noonday hush lay on all
the forest and the track, and there was not
a sign of life.</p>

<p>When we were an hour or two away, I
halted for a rest; the bite was getting at me
a little, and I felt slightly giddy, though I
knew by now that there was no danger.</p>

<p>“Tell me, what was all this thing that has
happened?” demanded the Marquis, dropping
on a log at my side and fanning himself
with his hat. “I am bursting of curiosity,
but I would not disturb you.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “if I had known Kata-Kata
as I know other districts in New
Guinea, none of them would have happened
at all. The whole thing might have been
foreseen. It’s true I had heard silly yarns
about this part of the country, but I didn’t
believe them, they seemed so exaggerated—and
they quite went out of my head, anyhow,
for I was hardly more than a kid when
I did hear them. But I’ve remembered
them today.”</p>

<p>“What were they, then?”</p>

<p>“People—natives, I mean—said that
the Kata-Kata sorcerers know how to tame
snakes and make them like dogs, and that
the brutes would bite any one their masters
told them to. The sorcerers would get a
bit of a man’s clothing, taken next his skin
where it had the scent of his body, and worry
and tease the snake with it so that it would
know the smell, and hate it. And then they
said the sorcerer would let loose his snake
at night in the house of the man he wanted
to kill, and the brute would bite him, and
the sorcerer would get it and take it home
again before he was seen.”</p>

<p>“<i>Taubada</i>, true you talk,” broke in
Koppi Koko, who was squatting on the
ground close to us, chewing betel-nut most
contentedly. “That puri-puri man, he
take him snake all the time ’long one bamboo,
carry him along him chest.”</p>

<p>“That accounts for the milk of the cocoanut,”
I said. “What a pair of babies to be
scared by a stick with a snake in it, hopping
about! Of course, the thing heard people
and was trying to get loose.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the snake—the cold snake—that
was the touch of death last night—not?”</p>

<p>“Very nearly,” I said. “The general
smash you made saved your life, Marky.”</p>

<p>“And the little beautiful, and the piece
cut out of her belt—yes, now one sees all,”
said the Marquis, musingly. “Flint, this
is a devil of a country of yours; but, on my
soul, it is interesting. What adventures!”</p>

<p>“I take no stock in adventures,” I said.
“I’d rather keep out of them. But I reckon,
somehow, there’s more ahead before we get
that stone.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Night</span> in Samarai Island town.</p>

<p>Stars in the water all round about
the houses; stars glinting and
disappearing, high among the eighteen-foot
leaves of Samarai’s splendid palms. At
the back of the island, where one walks for
quiet, the sea lying like a witch’s mirror of
black glass between the scarcely visible
white of the coral pathway and the dark,
lurking hills of Sariba and Basilisk.</p>

<p>Strolling there in the pleasant gloom, by
the fresh, salt-smelling straits, the Marquis
and I pursued our quest of the great stone
that we had seen in the charm-bag of Mo,
the Sorcerer of Kata-Kata, and that had
already nearly cost us our lives.</p>

<p>“I like this Samarai,” observed the Marquis,
treading along the tinkling gravel of
the path with the lightness Nature had
oddly linked to his enormous bulk. “So
small that you go round it all in the quarter
of an hour; so beautiful that it resembles
a dream of heaven. This place is Eden,
my friend.”</p>

<p>“So all the steamer passengers say,” I
answered. “If you’d seen some of the ladies
of Samarai punching one another’s heads
with umbrellas in front of Bunn’s Hotel, or
watched half the people of the town going
off in boats on Sunday afternoon and all
rowing away from each other, you’d maybe
reckon the Eden part was wearing a
little thin. You’ve never lived on coral
islands; I have.”</p>

<p>“I shut my eyes for what I do not like,
and look at the rest in a strange novelty
like this: I am not the new broom that
never rejoices,” replied the Marquis, twisting
the proverb in a superior tone. “We
are come here on a confounded dangerous
and fragile mission; therefore, we need all
the refreshness we can get for our minds.”</p>

<p>“Well, admire the scenery all you like,”
I said, “though I don’t see how it is going
to help you to find out where Mo has got
to with the diamond.”</p>

<p>“I demand of you, don’t we jolly well
know he is here?” asked the Marquis.
“Wasn’t it on the cause of that, that we
are come from Kata-Kata right off, as soon
as we are found that he is taken fright and
enlisted on a pearling vessel to get away
before the magistrate and ourselves should
come back to punish him?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know,” I said. “We only
guessed. You remember, when the police
had burned the town, and killed the pigs,
and all the people had run off into the bush,
being well scared, as they deserved to be—that
was when we heard from our boys that
Mo wasn’t there at all; but they only knew
he’d gone down to the coast.”</p>

<p>“But we ourselves, we knew that the
pearler vessel had been recruiting along
that veritable coast; that suffices, since the
boys have said that Mo recruited once a
long time ago to Thursday Island, and
knows the diving.”</p>

<p>“One can’t tell he didn’t merely go off
into the bush,” I said. “I’d rather he had.
A man who goes among a lot of pearlers
with a rough diamond about him that he
doesn’t know the value of, isn’t likely to
keep it long—if he keeps his life, he’s fortunate.”</p>

<p>“We shall know on tomorrow, when the
fleet comes in for Sunday. It seems to me
that I haven’t always been thankful enough
for Sunday. Flint, tell me, it is surely
unusual that a great sorcerer like Mo
should engage himself to work in a pearl
fleet?”</p>

<p>“Not so very,” I said. “He bosses the
other boys round a lot, as they’re all afraid
of him, and he generally manages to get
the best part of their wages. But I don’t
think Mo would have come away if he
hadn’t been scared. He certainly had a
very good job where he was.”</p>

<p>“He is wonderful, that man,” said the
Marquis, musingly. “I shall be glad to see
him again, although he has done so much
bad.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go asking after him,” I warned.
“Best leave it to me. We’re playing for a
big stake. My word, Marky, it is a big one!
All the money for everything we want, all
the rest of our lives—and we can’t afford
to excite suspicion. These pearler folk keep
their eyes skinned, I can tell you; they live
by that.”</p>

<p>“A stitch in time is as good as a mile. I
comprehend your warning, and leave it to
you,” said the Marquis, with what one
must call (for the want of a better term)
his most Marquisatorial air. “I have all
confidence in you. Do you think that they
may perhaps have some excellent billiard-tables
in those hotels?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think; I know they haven’t,” I
said. “But they have something we can
knock balls about on, if that will do.”</p>

<p>The next day was Saturday, and on Saturday
afternoon, according to the customs
of the pearling fleet, all the luggers were
due to come in for Sunday. It was not a
large fleet, there at Samarai. New Guinea
has never been much of a pearling center;
but Thursday and Broome Islands were
temporarily exhausted, and a few of the
fleet had run over to Samarai to try what
they could do about China Strait.</p>

<p>It is a nasty place for pearling: the shell
is none too plentiful, the depths are appalling;
and the current in the straits is at all
times exceedingly dangerous. Still, it is
better than nothing when nothing better
is to be had. The best class of pearler does
not come to New Guinea, as a rule. I expected
to see none but the riffraff of Thursday
Island when the fleet came in.</p>

<p>There were signs of their presence already.
Samarai had not been improved by
the shelling. The hotels were prosperous,
and, in consequence, rowdy; the Papuans,
who had come over from various places in
the Territory to take service with the fleet
in different ways, were a nasty-looking lot.
There was a new store, kept by a Greek
named George. It had divers’ gear in it,
also pearl-shell, curios, cards, dice, firearms,
and knives. I had heard something
of George himself, in my journeyings about
the north coasts of Australia, and I didn’t
think him an addition to the society of
Samarai, doubtful as the latter was.</p>

<p>However, I wanted a talk with him before
the boats came in; so I disposed of the
Marquis safely. It was not difficult: the
police were having a dance on the green
near the Government jetty, and he had
only to hear of it to be off like a bandicoot.
Then I went down the curious little
main street that is so like something in a
theater, with its primly built offices and
stores on one side, and the palms, and the
flaming blue sea, and the great carved canoes
from Misima Island on the other, to
the tin shanty where George the Greek was
to be found.</p>

<p>I bought some of his rubbishing curios
for a commencement, taking care to inform
him that I had a French nobleman
tourist in tow, as I knew well George the
Greek wasn’t likely to suppose I wanted the
stuff for myself. And I made the transaction
seem natural by demanding a percentage
on the sale, and getting it, too. (Of
course, I handed it over to the Marquis
afterward.) By this time the little beast
was quite pleasant and friendly, and disposed
to talk, so I proposed an adjournment
to the hotel, intending to pump him
cautiously as to the natives employed in
the fleet. He took his keys and began
shutting up shop; it was near closing time
already, and they don’t take much stock of
hours in an island town. I had a good look
at him while he locked up, and liked him not
at all. I had never seen him so close before.</p>

<p>He was good-looking, but unpleasantly so—black,
shiny eyes, too large, with lashes
too long; hooked Mephistophelian nose;
jet-black curls like a spaniel’s; boot-brush
mustache—all cheap and gaudy and smart-looking,
and all a bit greasy, somehow. He
had horrible little soft hands, with turn-back
fingers; and his figure, though good,
was as twisty and wriggly as a snake’s. It
came upon me right then that if there was
a man in New Guinea likely to give us
trouble about that stone (should any breath
of the secret creep out), there he stood—George
the Greek.</p>

<p>We didn’t get our talk in the hotel, after
all. Before the Greek had done locking up,
the natives raised a cry of “Sail-O!” and
we ran out to see if by any chance it was
the fleet. The hour was too early. I
scarcely expected anything but some stray
cutter up from Port Moresby or the East.</p>

<p>But it was the fleet—two hours before its
time. We saw the thin masts pricking like
black needles against the sky, a long way
off, as we stood among the trails of pink
beach convolvulus, looking into the Straits.
We saw the hulls rise up above the sea-line,
and the shapes of the little vessels appear,
and <span class="lock">then——</span></p>

<p>“Ba God, dey’re half-masted!” said the
Greek.</p>

<p>“Half-masted!” repeated the Marquis,
who had just turned up, the dance being
done. “But that signifies death!”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” I said. “Some one in
the fleet’s dead. That’s why they are coming
home early, and have their flags half-masted.
Look, you can see now—every
boat’s got it.”</p>

<p>“What was the name of the boat that
came recruiting?” asked the Marquis.</p>

<p>“The <i>Gertrude</i>,” I said, treading sharply
on his toe. He took the hint angelically.</p>

<p>“Da <i>Gertrude</i>, she is coming first,” contributed
the Greek, watching. “There is
a nigger on da <i>Gertrude</i>, he owe me three
pound nineteen shillin’. I hope he is not
dead.”</p>

<p>“A Malay?” I asked.</p>

<p>“A New Guinea—Mo. He is bad man,
dat Mo. He promise, he no pay. I go
down to da jet’, and look. If he is dead, I
make da owner pay me.”</p>

<p>We tramped down together through the
burning sun to the wooden jetty that
stretched its stilty legs out into water of
such a wonderful green that nobody could
hope to describe it or compare it to anything
save itself. We waited there for near
half an hour, before the fleet came up—a
dozen or so of poor-looking luggers, dirty
and ill-mannered. The <i>Gertrude</i> came in
first, and George the Greek was into a
dingey and over her gunwale before she had
time to drop anchor. In a minute he reappeared,
with a face of demoniac fury; spat
violently over the counter, cursed the ship
and all in her in at least four different
languages, and jumped into his boat again.</p>

<p>“Lost your money?” I asked, as the
dingey shot up to the steps.</p>

<p>George the Greek did not reply, otherwise
than by stating, in gross and in detail,
the things he would do to the owner of the
<i>Gertrude</i>—should fortune favor him with a
chance. The owner of the <i>Gertrude</i>, meantime,
a fair, flushed, bloated man, who
seemed to have been drinking, and to have
arrived at the pathetic stage, leaned over
the counter and called out to George to
“let the poor blighter rest in ’is blooming
grave, and don’t go bringin’ bad luck on
yourself by cursin’ the dead.”</p>

<p>“He got no grave!” shouted George, with
much bad language. (He seemed to think
it a very mean circumstance that Mo
should have no grave.) “He lie dere at
bottom of da sea, like one damned lobsta.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you make no mistake,” rejoined
the captain with drunken gravity. “He’s
here in the cabin, wrapped in his dress, as
we took the poor blighter up, and he’ll be
buried proper, just as he is. No one can
say I don’t treat my niggers decent, dead
or alive. Good Joe Gilbert: that’s what
I’m known as, and that’s what I am.” He
took a bottle out of his pocket and inverted
it on his nose.</p>

<p>“Marky,” I said quietly, “I’d be much
obliged if you would go off and wait for
me somewhere; I’ll join you by and by.
I want to see if Mo left any baggage that
we could get hold of, and the fewer of us
there are in it, the better. We don’t want
to attract notice.”</p>

<p>“I go,” said the Marquis, departing. “I
wait near the shop of the Greek. He interest
me, somehow, that beggar.”</p>

<p>I waited until George had gone off, cursing,
and then got aboard the lugger. The
captain, on hearing that I was collecting
curios for the Marquis, let me see all the
stuff that Mo had left behind. His sorcerer’s
bag, full of the odds and ends we had
already seen, lay in a corner of the little
forecastle. I scarcely expected to find
what I was looking for there, and I did not.
After purchasing one or two bits of carving
at a price that put the captain in a good
temper, I asked him if that was all the
Papuan had had.</p>

<p>“All that I know of,” he said, “unless
it was the rubbish he used to put round his
neck before he’d get into the diving-dress.”</p>

<p>My heart beat a little faster. “What was
that?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t tell you; some of their sorcerer’s
charms. Most like, a bone or a
queer bit of coral. His brother would tie
it on for him; most times he went down
he’d have something of the sort, and he’d
be praying to his devils before he started,
to keep away the sharks. Seems to me he
got the wrong sort of prayer under way:
his devils kept away the sharks all right,
but they didn’t take no care about divers’
paralysis, and that’s what got Mo. He
was dead Lord knows how long when we
pulled him up, and he must have lost his
air, as he’s all jammed into the helmet and
corselet, and we can’t get it off.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” I said, picking up my purchases.
“I’ll go and take these to the Marquis.”</p>

<p>I found him waiting near the Greek’s,
looking at the things displayed in the window.
Among them was a diving-dress
complete: great copper and gun-metal
helmet joined to a wide breast-plate or
“corselet;” leaden-soled boots; rubber-cloth
body.</p>

<p>“Did you see that dress?” I asked, as we
walked on. “Mo’s inside of one just like
it, jammed in tight. I didn’t see him, but
I have seen that sort of thing before. The
face is all flattened out against the glasses
of the helmet....”</p>

<p>“Enough, enough!” cried the Marquis.</p>

<p>“It isn’t enough,” I said. “I’ve got to
explain, for a reason. Well, being like
that, there’s no getting them out of the
dress without cutting them to pieces, so
it’s the custom of the diving trade to bury
them as they are. Mo will be buried this
afternoon over at the cemetery island.
And—<em>and</em>—anything he may have had on
his person when he died will be buried with
him. And, Marky, the captain told me
he usually went down with some sort of a
charm hung round his neck. And the
diamond’s not among his gear that he left
behind.”</p>

<p>“It is too horrible!” said the Marquis,
his pink face paling.</p>

<p>“All right; if you think it is, I don’t.
I’ll take over your share and welcome.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t desire that.” The color
was coming back to his face. “If it must
be, it shall. Tell me all you think.”</p>

<p>“Come for a walk round the island, and
we’ll talk,” I said, leading off by the big
Calophyllum tree that bears such fine nuts.
We didn’t say much till we were away at
the back of the island, where we had strolled
the night before. It looked fine there:
the view was like the back-cloth to the
scene of “The Pirate’s Island” in a melodrama,
and the arcade of palms was cool
and green in the glare of the afternoon.</p>

<p>We talked, walking up and down. I did
not want to go back to the town side until
we had finished our plan of campaign, for
Samarai, like all tiny island towns, is full
of ears. The Marquis, I must say, came
out rather well here; he had a good, clear
head of his own, when it wasn’t temporarily
thrown out of business by one of his three
fads, and, as there was no dancing, no
sorcery, and nothing with a petticoat,
grass or silken, in this affair, he was quite
sensible.</p>

<p>“First it is to discover,” he said, “whether
any one has found out about the stone.
What do you think?”</p>

<p>“No knowing,” I said, “but I think not,
on the whole. Mo had only been here a
few days, and unless he was actually doing
magic, he wouldn’t have been opening up
his bag. You know he was shy of that,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Point one: It was probably not discovered
that he had the stone. Point two:
Had he taken the stone with him when he
dived?”</p>

<p>“Again, no knowing. But I reckon he
did. There’d be room on his chest below
the corselet—that’s the breastplate thing
that extends over the diver’s shoulders and
chest, to keep off water pressure. And, if
he didn’t know what a diamond was, he
certainly valued the thing a lot, for his
sorcery work. And the captain says he
usually took some charm to keep him safe.”</p>

<p>“Good. Point three: How shall we do
this sacrilege, since it is convented that we
do it?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to wait a few days, till the
nights are dark all through—there’s an
hour or two of moonlight just now—go over
to the cemetery island in a canoe by ourselves,
and do what we have to do. Makes
you creep, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I creep, but I think of my beautiful
château in Indre-et-Loire, all ruined, and
my mother, who is already very old, and
who has but little money for the candles
she will burn in church at my safety in
traveling, and then, by Jove, old chap, I
say to me that the proof of the pudding
sweeps clean, as your excellent English
proverbs make it, and I decide to act.”</p>

<p>“Well, your proverbs are original, Marky,
but I don’t know that they haven’t a queer
sort of sense of their own. A pudding this
size ought to sweep most things clean—if
you will have it that way. And we’re not
breaking any law of God or man that I
know of, in taking a diamond from a corpse
that didn’t know what to do with it when
he was alive, and doesn’t need it now.”</p>

<p>“Perfectly.”</p>

<p>“There’s only one thing. Don’t get to
asking any questions anywhere of any kind
of person, about anything. I hope that’s
definite. Because you might, without
meaning it in the least, get George or some
other fellow thinking, and we don’t want
them to think.”</p>

<p>“I comprehend perfectly. Flint, this is
altogether so good that I feel myself exalted.
I will dance——”</p>

<p>“No, Marky, don’t,” I begged. “Somebody
might come. I like your dancing all
right, and I think you’d knock spots off
Pavlova and Mordkin, and the girl who
served up prophet’s head—but I don’t want
you to dance now. Anything that excites
remark and draws attention to us two is
going to be bad policy at present. Swear
off, Marky, if you’re wise.”</p>

<p>“It was but the dance of <i>Marguerite</i>
with the casket of jewels that I desired
to make—nothing more, my friend,” said
the Marquis, a little wistfully. “The
dance, I mean, that she ought to make—it
is never right done by the theater.”</p>

<p>“Wait till you get the jewel before you
start jewel dances,” I said. “Did you
ever hear of the cuckoo clock and the parson?”</p>

<p>“Never; tell me of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, there was once a poor woman who
had a cuckoo clock, and the clock stopped,
and wouldn’t go on. Now it happened just
then that the parson came in to make a
call on her, and he was rather a bit of an
amateur clock-maker.</p>

<p>“So he took the clock off home with him
to fix up, and the poor woman was overcome
with gratitude. And, by and by,
he sent it back, saying it was all right. A
few days after, he called on the poor woman
again, and said, in that high and mighty
tone a lot of parsons have, ‘Well, my good
woman, how does your clock go now?’
And the poor creature said, trembling,
‘Thank you, sir, it’s only too kind of you,
sir, and it goes very well indeed, sir.
There’s only just one little thing, sir—since
you was so good as to mend it, it oos before
it cucks!’ Mark, don’t you ever oo before
you cuck. Lots of people do, and it’s a
mighty bad habit to get into.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, I will remember, and I will
not dance the dance of <i>Marguerite</i> and the
jewels, or indeed any dance at all. You
have much wisdom, Flint,” said the Marquis,
quite gravely. “I am afraid it shall
be a good while that we have to wait and
do nothing. Truly, hope deferred makes a
long turning.”</p>

<p>It certainly seemed a long time, though
it was only a week, before I thought the
nights were dark enough to carry out our
plan. In the blazing moonlight of New
Guinea some wandering native would without
doubt have seen us crossing the straits
to the cemetery island, even if no white
man spied us. The moonless nights were
our only chance. But it was irksome to
wait, and wonder and speculate whether
any one, by any possible chance, knew as
much as we knew ourselves.</p>

<p>Well, the moonless nights came round,
and the evening I had fixed upon arrived.
It was Saturday, when I reckoned that the
greater part of Samarai would be drunk
and not in a condition to notice any one’s
movements very closely. I had not adopted
a disguise, which the Marquis was very
anxious for me to do. I explained to him
that one might as well hope to disguise the
keeper of an elephant successfully—the
elephant would be bound to give him
away. And the elephant itself, I added,
couldn’t be made to look like anything but
an elephant.</p>

<p>The conclusion was obvious. We did
not disguise.</p>

<p>With two spades and a pick in the bottom
of a good, double-outrigged canoe, we
set out quietly from the beach in the starlit
dusk, not too early and not too late. There
was not the least difficulty about it, which
fact I am sure disappointed the Marquis
terribly. I think he would have liked to
black his face and wear a conspirator’s
cloak, and wriggle on his stomach from the
hotel to the beach, and have half-a-dozen
Greeks and Malays chase him with revolvers.</p>

<p>But, as a matter of fact, nobody saw us,
and we got away without so much as a
splash.</p>

<p>It was a glorious night: we floated in a
hollow globe of stars—stars above, stars
below, some flashing like the great diamond
we had gone out to find, some glowing like
little moons and casting long spears of
light into the sea. We had a mile or two
to go to the cemetery island; I paddled all
the way, and the Marquis, crouched rather
uncomfortably on the rough perch that does
duty for a seat in native canoes, sang softly
to himself in I do not know how many
languages. The more his emotions were
stirred, the more polyglot he became, as
a rule. He seemed to be a perfect Tower of
Babel that night.</p>

<p>We grounded on a white sand beach that
shone faintly in the starlight, and made our
way up to the cemetery, along a dank,
overgrown track, with the weird nightbirds
of New Guinea chipping and sawing,
and clanking bells, and cracking whips, in
the bush alongside. The intoxicating scent
of the tropical forest came sweet and strong
in our faces, on the fresh night-breeze—the
smell that “makes your heart-strings
crack,” when you encounter it unexpectedly
in some warm, scented hothouse, far away
from the burning equatorial lands.</p>

<p>I do not think either of us thought more
than we could help of the horrible task we
had come to do. I, for one, rigidly kept
my mind away from it, and thought only
of the stone.... How many carats was
it?—I wondered. We were all familiar
with the photographs of the great Cullinan
in the rough, just then. I judged the
Sorcerer’s Stone, compared with that, to be
small, but large compared with any other
in the world. Say, three hundred in the
rough.... What would it cut to? How
much would it be worth? How many tens
of thousands? And who would buy such a
costly gem?</p>

<p>Sometimes these very large diamonds
were harder to dispose of than smaller
stones, since purchasers were so few. There
were the millionaires of America—and the
rajahs of India—and it would take the
very biggest of either to make bids for our
treasure, when we got it.</p>

<p>I didn’t say <em>if</em> we got it. I was determined
that we should get it.</p>

<p>We had no lanterns with us: the light of
the stars was enough for a good bushman,
and I knew the cemetery track by heart.
So do most men who have lived long in
New Guinea.</p>

<p>I guessed where the diver must have been
buried: there were not many suitable spots
left. We stumbled along among the overgrown,
neglected mounds, destitute of name
or stone to mark them out one from
another, and found what I was looking for—a
new, bare grave. I think my heart
was beating rather fast as I struck a match
and looked, to make sure....</p>

<p>I dropped the match, and stamped on it.</p>

<p>“Marquis,” I said, “we’re done—” and
my voice sounded strange in my own ears,
as I spoke.</p>

<p>“They are before us?” cried the Marquis,
going down on his knees by the grave. “A
match!”</p>

<p>“No good,” I said, striking one, however,
for a moment. “You see how the
ground’s trampled—and the grave has certainly
been dug up, and covered in very
roughly afterward. We’ll open it, of
course, but——”</p>

<p>“They would make a grave of a native
roughly! They would trample about it!”</p>

<p>“Not on the top of it, Mark. When
you’re burying a man, black or white, you
don’t stamp over his head. No, you take
my word for it, we’ve lost this trick. But
even if we have, we’ve not lost the game.
Remember, we’re on an island, and there
isn’t a boat for another fortnight.”</p>

<p>I was digging as I spoke, spading up the
loose soil in big lumps, and throwing it out
of the way. The Marquis, again with his
Marquisatorial air, took up the other spade,
and joined in. I told him not to worry,
but he insisted.</p>

<p>“It would not be fitting a gentleman of
France, if I should let you commit this sin
for me, and not sin also,” he said. I
thought that if the measure of his iniquity
were to be calculated by the amount of
digging he got through, it needn’t trouble
his conscience much; but I said nothing,
even when he caught a crab with his spade,
and fell almost on top of me. It pleased
him, and did not harm any one—least of
all, in my opinion, the poor black wretch
below.</p>

<p>In a very few minutes our spades struck
something. I felt about in the soil, and
touched a soft, indefinite mass. Exploring
carefully, I found, to my astonishment,
that, whatever else I might discover in the
grave, there was no heavy metal helmet
and corselet. It was imperative to strike a
light now, no matter what the risk, and I
took out a little bit of candle I had brought
with me.</p>

<p>There is no need to say exactly what I
saw, or detail anything I may have done.
It was a brief business. Almost at once, I
understood that the grave had been opened,
as I had feared; that the body had been
removed from the helmet and corselet with
considerable violence, and that, whatever
else there might be in the ravaged tomb of
Mo, ex-sorcerer of Kata-Kata town, diamond
there was none.</p>

<p>You might think that the Marquis and I
would have been knocked over by this.
We weren’t a bit. We were disappointed;
but we had been disappointed about the
sorcerer’s stone before, and the chances of
getting it were not much worse now than
they had been on our arrival. Samarai, a
very small island, with every one in sight
of every one else all the time, and no calling
steamer due, was about as good a hunting-ground
as one could wish for. And,
anyhow, I didn’t mean to lose heart, if
things looked twice as black. So I told the
Marquis, and he agreed with me. He even
offered to prove how little he was discouraged
by doing the war-dance of the
priests in “Athalie” all the way back to
the shore. I told him I had always reckoned
it was a march, and he explained he
would do the dance they ought to have
done, and didn’t.</p>

<p>As I wanted to return as quickly as possible,
I persuaded him to put off the performance
until we had got back to the
town. I thought he would have forgotten
it by that time, but he hadn’t. The spectacle
of the Marquis, in a very dirty singlet
and trousers and bare, sandy feet, doing
the war-dance of the priests by starlight all
down the main street of Samarai at two
o’clock in the morning is one of the things
that I expect to remember all the rest of
my life.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Next morning, as might have been expected,
we were both suffering from the
sort of mental sore-head that follows after
great excitement, and in consequence were
somewhat depressed. We walked round
and round the island, chafing, as every one
in Samarai chafes, at its narrow confines,
and discussing the affair of the diamond
ceaselessly. I don’t think I shall ever see
green palms on a white shore again, or
smell the dank, weedy smell of a coral reef,
without thinking of diamonds and divers
and graves. We talked it over inside and
out, and upside down, and arrived at the
following conclusion:</p>

<p>George the Greek was probably at the
bottom of the matter.</p>

<p>But why George the Greek was at the
bottom of the matter, we did not understand.</p>

<p>If George the Greek had known of the
diamond, he would have got it away from
Mo by fraud or force, long before our
arrival in Samarai or Mo’s unlucky death.
He would have got it, if he had had to cut
the sorcerer to pieces, alive.</p>

<p>But if George the Greek did not know
about the stone (and, indeed, his conduct
on the jetty suggested that he did not),
why should he dig the body up?</p>

<p>These conclusions seemed to point to the
fact that George the Greek had not been
in the matter, after all. But neither the
Marquis nor I would accept that explanation—I
am sure I do not know why. We
said we felt he had been in it; and the
Marquis proposed a visit to his store, to
find out what we could.</p>

<p>In the hot, sleepy hours of the afternoon
we went down to George’s little shanty,
feeling more dispirited, now, than either of
us would have cared to admit. The Marquis,
I think, wouldn’t have danced the
war-dance of the priests for an audience of
a hundred pretty women. I wouldn’t have
laughed at one of his upside-down proverbs
for a case of iced champagne. The street
was steaming with the peculiarly unpleasant
heat that follows after a heavy shower
in a high temperature, and the sea, under
the westering sun, dazzled like a mirror
flashed in one’s eyes by a mischievous
boy.</p>

<p>The Marquis said, as far as I gathered,
that “a feeling of sadness came o’er him
that his heart could not resist,” and I said
that I felt like chewed string.</p>

<p>Then happened something that put
starch into both of us, as quickly as if the
thermometer had dropped twenty degrees.
We heard a row beginning.</p>

<p>“By gum, my friend, they fight somewhere;
let’s go and see,” said the Marquis.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be the father of a row, I
reckon,” said I, cheerfully. “Hurry up, or
we’ll miss the best.” For the shouts and
stamps that we had heard were rising into
a chorus of yells, punctuated by crashes,
and by shrill screams from one especial
voice. It was not a woman’s voice, but it
wasn’t exactly like the ordinary white
man’s, and it had a shrewish quality in it
that I seemed to recognize.</p>

<p>“George, for a sovereign!” I cried. And
I began to run, the Marquis coming after
as quickly as he could—which was quicker
than you would think, if you had never
seen him in action.</p>

<p>George’s shanty, when we reached it,
was invisible, except for the roof. The rest
had disappeared under a sort of human
wave. At least twenty men, black, white,
and yellow, were shoving and fighting in
front of it, all apparently moved by one
desire—to get inside. From within the store
came the owner’s frantic yells, mingled with
language that really was astonishing, even for
a Greek. And the crashing and smashing
and banging went on and on, getting louder.</p>

<p>Helping each other as two strong men
can, the Marquis and I shoved somehow
through the press—which, we now observed,
was composed entirely of divers.
This was Sunday, and the fleet, of course,
did not work, so a number of white men
and a few Papuans, Malays, and Japs, all
employed on the luggers as a rule, were left
free to spend the Sabbath as they liked.
It seemed that this was what they liked;
and it looked very much like burglary,
battery, and murder.</p>

<p>“What’s the row, Bob?” I yelled through
the noise to a diver whom I recognized.
He had a tomahawk in his hand and was
smashing the window-frame of the store,
the window-panes having long since gone.
Inside, I could see the Greek literally tearing
his hair—the first time I had ever seen
any one do it; up till then, I thought only
people in books did so—and trying to get
away from Big Carl, a huge Swede, who
had got both arms around George and was
holding on like the serpent in the statue
whose name I can’t remember.</p>

<p>All the divers who could get into the
store were inside, and they were very busy
indeed, wrecking it with tomahawks. The
counter was gone, the shelves were firewood,
the curios and shells were smashed,
and there were some indistinguishable fragments
of metal on the floor, which seemed
to arouse the special hatred of the invaders.
Bob, too, while I was trying to make him
hear, got away from me, and into the store;
and immediately he began hacking away at
the metal on the floor. It looked, what
was left of it, rather like a diver’s
corselet.</p>

<p>I wanted to know what it was all about,
and as no one seemed disposed to stop long
enough to tell me, I “cut out” by main
force another man I knew and hauled him
half across the street. He swore at me,
and tried to fight, but I held him.</p>

<p>“You’ll go when you’ve told me what
the row is about,” I said.</p>

<p>The man, swearing at intervals, told me.</p>

<p>“It’s George the Greek,” he said. “Will
you let me go?” (Blank.) “It was the helmet
and corselet—Parratt, of the <i>Dawn</i>,
wanted to buy one, and George had a
second-hand one in his window, cheap—They’re
smashing the floor now—why
didn’t I think of that? Let me go.”
(Impolite expressions.) “Well, if you
won’t” (impoliteness continued), “Parratt
was looking at it, to decide if he’d go in
and buy it tomorrow—it was only nine
pounds, and a new one’s fourteen, and
Parratt thought he would, and he looked at
it close, and he saw a rivet in the helmet,
and he knew the rivet, because he put it
there himself—Oh!” (very impolite remarks)
“they’ve got him frog’s-marched,
and they’re going to throw him—Don’t hit
me, I’ll finish—And the corselet was the
one they buried with Mo, the Papuan who
got drowned the other day, and the beast
had dug him up and cut him out of it, to
make the price of what Mo owed him. So
when all the divers heard that” (Will you
let me go? they’re taking him to the jetty!),
“they came and made a row. Damn!”</p>

<p>He bit a new litany off at the commencement,
as I released him, and made for the
jetty at a run. I saw them swing the yelling
Greek out over the water, and let him
go with a splash. He could swim all right,
and a ducking was likely to do him good,
so I didn’t trouble to interfere, especially
as I saw that the men had about satiated
their anger. I went back to the Marquis,
who was staring blankly at the whole proceeding,
and told him what I had heard.</p>

<p>“Admirable, excellent!” he said. “What
we tried to do, and have not done, they
are wrecking the shop of the Greek on
account of. My friend, I see that you and
I are certainly black-watches.”</p>

<p>“No, Marky, no fear. We’ll keep what
we know about ourselves to ourselves, but
there’s not a man in the fleet would call
you or me blackguard for what we’ve tried
to do.”</p>

<p>“And for why?”</p>

<p>“Because,” I said, “this is a pearling
fleet. And in a pearling fleet you may
do anything you like, sacrilege, robbery,
piracy, or murder, for a pearl, if only it’s
big enough. No one would think any the
less of you really, though they might have
to pretend they did, if there were too many
authorities about. As for a diamond like
old Mo’s—why, you might dig up the whole
of the cemetery without upsetting any
one’s stomach or conscience. But divers
don’t like being hacked out of their dresses
when they die in them, which they do
pretty often, to gratify the meanness of a
mean little cur like George. That’s the
case, Marky. Anyhow, you and I have no
cause to quarrel with it, for it’s shown us
that we were on a wrong scent after all. If
the Greek had found such a thing as a diamond
under the corselet—and mind you,
he made mincemeat of old Mo, getting him
out of it—he’d never have taken the risk he
did, in showing off the gear second-hand.”</p>

<p>“Then,” demanded the Marquis, “where
is the diamond?”</p>

<p>“That’s what we’ve got to find out yet,”
I said.</p>

<h4>
THE FIGHT AT TWELVE FATHOMS<br>
</h4>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was no use. I threw down my pen,
tossed my unfinished letters on the
floor, and went out with murder in my
heart. The mail was due in a day or two,
and I had neglected all my relations and
friends for so long that they must have
had every reason for thinking me dead.
But not a word could I write.</p>

<p>There was a native singing on the beach
below the hotel: the day was hot and windless,
and one could hear every sound. No
one who has ever lived in Papua will want
to be told why I could not go on with my
mail.</p>

<p>For the benefit of those who have not,
I may explain that, of all maddening
sounds ever invented by the malice or
ingenuity of man, Papuan solo-singing is a
long way the worst. The choral singing is
noisy and not very musical, but it lacks the
brain-destroying texture of the solo. An
idle Papuan native (and a Papuan is always
idle, unless some one is making him work)
seems able to pass away half a day, at any
time, chanting his own autobiography, and
the history of his immediate friends, in a
long-drawn nasal howl that holds one note
till you feel the very substance of your
brain giving way under its hideous boring—and
then takes a sudden gimlet twist.</p>

<p>At this point you get up, saying things
that in all likelihood do no credit to your
education and upbringing, and throw the
twelve-pound clam-shell that probably ornaments
the veranda, right at the furry
head of the singer. A clam-shell has a row
of sharp points on its edge, and it is extremely
solid. As a rule, it penetrates far
enough to convey your wishes. If it does
not, or if the singer takes it for an encore
and goes on again, you can generally find a
tomahawk somewhere about the house.</p>

<p>But on this occasion the singer was invisible,
down on the beach, and out of clam-shot,
also out of boot, stove-lifter, jug, and
tomahawk shot. The only thing was to go
and find him.... Down the stairs, through
the bar, and out across the glaring sandy
street, where the shadows of the palms
were faint and feeble, in the cruel midday
sun.... The scrap of bush that shaded
the sea-beach concealed me as I stole along.
I meant to catch him at it.</p>

<p>“Yah-yah aaaaaaaaaaah-yah, yah-yah
aaaaaah, yah-ah, yah-ah!” burst forth another
preliminary yell. I halted for a minute
to locate the sound. The singer took
breath, and went on in a tone that bored
through one’s ears exactly as a dentist’s
drill bores when it is coming down on the
nerve of a tooth. The words were distinguishable
now, in spite of the chanting
manner. I caught a sentence as I drew
near.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” I said to myself, and
straightened up, all idea of vengeance disappearing
from my mind like the foam on the
Straits when a southeaster flings it ashore.
The man was singing in a dialect that I
knew—the usual bald recitative about various
native affairs. But there was something
in this recitative that concerned me
very nearly, or I was much mistaken. I
stood and listened. At first I could only
hear the word for “sorcerer” coming in
again and again, mingled with “Kata-Kata”—the
name of the district where we
had been first met with the wonderful
diamond that the Marquis and I were now
pursuing. Then the chanting became
clearer:</p>

<p>“Aaaaa-yah, Mo is dead, Mo is dead and
buried, and his spirit walks about and bites
men as they sleep. Aaaaaaah-yah!</p>

<p>“Aaaaa-yah, ah-yah, yah, Mo, the great
sorcerer, did not take his charm. Ah-yah,
ah-yah, he took it before, and he did not die.
Aaaaaa! when he did not take it, he died.</p>

<p>“Aaah, aaaaah, ah-yah, the brother of
Mo will not die: the brother of Mo will take
it. Aaaaah! Aaaah! Aaaah!”</p>

<p>The song, or chant, was repeated more
than once while I listened. Evidently the
singer had been running it off like a phonograph
for some time. He was a Kiwai from
the west and he used the Kiwai tongue,
which many white men understand, especially
among the pearling crowd. I wondered
whether any one besides myself had
heard him, and whether, if any one had, the
chant had conveyed any special meaning.</p>

<p>It did not seem likely. Most white men
pay no more attention to native singing
than they pay to a howling dog. If the
singing or the howling annoys you, you
throw something at the disturber of your
peace: that is all.</p>

<p>Further, if any one did hear it and take
notice of it, there was nothing dangerous in
the song—unless one had the clue—the
knowledge of what the charm really was.
Had any one the clue save myself and the
Marquis? Had George the Greek—who
had dug Mo out of his grave, to get his
diving dress? Impossible. Still, I might as
well stop the singing: it was certainly irritating,
and the Kiwai had no right to be
annoying the town in the middle of the
day, almost opposite the hotel.</p>

<p>I went down on to the beach, and
shouted to him to stop. He seemed to understand
English well enough, and he did
stop, though with an amazed and injured
air. I noted that he was a boy I had not
seen before; probably a diver, though he
did not seem to be on duty. He was loafing
on the sand, with a big, opened cocoanut
beside him, and he looked extremely comfortable
and lazy.</p>

<p>“Why aren’t you out with the boats?”
I asked. I did not question him about his
song: very few Papuans, no matter how
well you may know them, will tell you anything
about their chants, and I was, as I
say, a stranger to this boy.</p>

<p>“Me sick,” he said, with a grin. I never
saw a sturdier specimen of a malingerer.</p>

<p>“You no sick, you too much fright,” I said.</p>

<p>“Yes, me fright,” he agreed. “All a time
too much fright, long that puri-puri man
(sorcerer) he die. I no want I die finish all
same. Me sick, more better.”</p>

<p>“You rascal,” I said, “what boat do you
belong to?”</p>

<p>“<i>Gertrude</i>,” he answered, turning the
cocoanut up on his face, and drinking
loudly.</p>

<p>“Brother belong Mo, Kata-Kata boy,
stop along <i>Gertrude</i>? Man he got too much
big ear?” I asked, making signs about my
own ears.</p>

<p>“Yes, he stop.”</p>

<p>“He puri-puri man?”</p>

<p>“What-name that word? I no savvy,”
said the savage, looking at me with cunningly
narrowed eyes.</p>

<p>I saw it was no use trying to pump him,
so I left. As I came out into the street I
saw George the Greek in front of me, walking
rather aslant, as if he had just come up
from the neighborhood of the beach himself.
He did not look behind, but walked
quickly on, and disappeared inside the
ruins of his store. I thought there was
nothing in it; yet, somehow, I would rather
not have seen him there.</p>

<p>I went back to the Marquis overjoyed
with my discovery, but before telling him
I got him outside, and out of range of the
hotel. In Papua, if you see two men out
in the open, talking confidentially together,
you may be sure that they are talking
secrets. All Papua’s important secrets are
discussed under the sky. The iron house of
New Guinea, with its low partitions, and
the projecting veranda roof that acts as a
natural sounding-board, is, I suppose, about
the worst place in the world for talking over
private matters—apart from the fact that a
native who understands English, or a curious
white man, may be standing unseen
under the floor at your very feet.</p>

<p>“This is good,” said the Marquis. “I can
take heart again; I was beginning to fear
that we had lost that wonderful-wicked
valuable. Still, the shorn lamb must not
halloo till it is out of the window. What
will we do?”</p>

<p>“Well, it seems so simple,” said I, “that
I can hardly believe it. But from what I
see, all we have to do is to catch Mo’s
brother when he comes back tonight, get
him in a quiet place, offer him a pound or
two for the stone, and take it right off. A
nigger who’s been with the Thursday Island
fleet, even if it was some years ago, will
know the value of money.”</p>

<p>“What will you offer?” asked the Marquis.</p>

<p>“Curio price,” I said. “From ten shillings
to a couple of pounds. If he seems
very much attached to it, spring five pounds
more. One must be careful not to give so
much that the other white men would hear
of it and get thinking. Otherwise, I see no
trouble.”</p>

<p>“It seems too good to be true,” said the
Marquis thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it was.</p>

<p>When the <i>Gertrude</i> got in that evening,
I was on the jetty looking out for her. So
was the Marquis; so was George the Greek.
He never glanced at either of us, and seemed
to be quite absorbed in cutting up some
singularly villainous looking tobacco. But
when the lugger had run alongside the jetty,
and the boys were coming off, he attached
himself to the bat-eared man, and followed
him down the street. We followed also,
perplexed.</p>

<p>“Do you think he knows?” whispered
the Marquis.</p>

<p>“He can’t,” I said. “I should guess that
he thinks we’re trying to do illicit pearl
buying. The result’s the same, however.
He’ll probably stick to us.”</p>

<p>He did. He loafed along in the rear of
the bat-eared man until the two reached the
temporary shed put up for the native divers
to sleep in. Then he sat down on the
ground outside the shed, stuffed his pipe
full of the ugly tobacco, and coolly began
to smoke.</p>

<p>“He’s prepared for all night,” I said.
“Let’s leave him. He knows nothing really,
or he wouldn’t tag round after us like this.
For two pins I’d give him a hammering—”</p>

<p>We went and left him, still smoking.</p>

<p>I slept badly that night, on account of a
touch of fever. In consequence, I was late
up next morning, and the Marquis, who
was always an early riser, was dressed and
out-of-doors when I awoke. I was just
preparing to rise when he came into my
room and sat down on the bed, his pink
face curiously pale.</p>

<p>“Flint, my Flint!” he said. “Give me a
brandy. I am shook.”</p>

<p>I gave it to him, and asked what was the
matter. He drank quickly, and looked
round the room before replying.</p>

<p>“It is too much, this,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“It’s not too much—I only gave you a
couple of fingers,” I said.</p>

<p>“Not that—the bat man, I mean. Flint,
God of my Gods, he is walking up and down
the main street on this minute, with the
stone slung round his neck, like a locket!”</p>

<p>“And nothing on it!” I exclaimed—if
you can exclaim under your breath.</p>

<p>“There is but a small native case of
weaved grass, and see you, he has left the
end that it almost shows out—one can see
the entire shape of it!”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you buy it right there!”
I demanded, jumping out of bed, and beginning
to fling on my clothes with all
possible haste.</p>

<p>A New Guinea native walking down the
main street of Samarai, in broad day, with
the second largest diamond of modern
times slung round his neck! It was indeed
a nice situation.</p>

<p>“My Flint, it was impossible. The
Greek, he was looking out of his window all
the time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hang the Greek! It’s better the
news of the stone should get out—once
we’ve got it—than that it should be knocking
loose round Samarai like that,” I declared.
“It’s true that if we let the folks
here get wind of it, we shall have to sleep
on it in turns, and keep sort of watch and
watch all the time till the boat comes, and
after that the real fun will only be beginning.
But anything’s better than losing it. Why,
that confounded Greek may suspect already
what we are after. Come on.” I counted
out a handful of sovereigns, put them in my
pocket, and started off.</p>

<p>The bat-eared man was nowhere to be
seen.</p>

<p>“He’s gone to breakfast before they
start,” I said, turning back toward the
native quarters. Just as plainly as if he
were before my eyes, I could see the little
Papuan, with his woolly head and cramped,
crooked figure, striding along with the price
of a kingdom a-swing about his greasy neck,
in a rude locket of grass—the treasure that
would assuredly glitter in the crown of a
queen, or shine upon the turban of some rich
Indian rajah, within a few brief months.</p>

<p>For, whether the Marquis and I secured
it or whether we did not, the destiny of
the Sorcerer’s Stone was fixed by this time.
It had passed too near civilization to escape.
Its track of blood and terror—the track
of every great diamond—was opening out
before it. What had the Marquis said in
Kata-Kata—“First blood for the diamond:
I wonder who shall be the next?”</p>

<p>The next had been the sorcerer himself.
And the next after that?...</p>

<p>The man was not in the quarters; none
of the boys was there. The remains of
their meal were scattered about the ground.
It seemed that for some reason or other the
boats were going early today.</p>

<p>“The jetty, and look sharp!” I said.</p>

<p>We looked as sharp as we could, but the
<i>Gertrude</i> was off before we got half-way down
the street. Others of the fleet preceded her;
one remained behind.</p>

<p>“Come on, Marky,” I said. “We’ll go
with the fleet today. We’re curious to see
the pearling, you know.”</p>

<p>“I have seen it many confounded times
in other countries, and I am quite fatigued
of it,” declared the Marquis. “Always one
gets some ugly shells, and one does not find
no pearls, and they tell one foolish stories,
and there is gin, and one goes home.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re going to see it some more,”
I said.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Dawn</i> was willing to
take us out for a consideration. He was a
long time getting away from the jetty, and
I grew more impatient every minute, for
there was the <i>Gertrude</i> far ahead, and gradually
drawing out of sight, while we still delayed.
By the time the <i>Dawn</i> had spread
her dirty sails to the breeze, the other lugger
had diminished to a speck.</p>

<p>The Marquis and I sat side by side on the
hatch, watching Sariba and the Basilisk
open out into emerald and purple bays, and
the tall blue D’Entrecasteaux show up on
the far horizon. We did not talk: we were
too anxious.</p>

<p>We cast anchor in a wide plain of blue
water, with the <i>Gertrude</i> not very far away.
She was anchored also, and I saw by the
ladder and the trailing air-tube that her
diver was down. Looking closer, a second
air-tube appeared.</p>

<p>“Why, she has two down,” I said.</p>

<p>“She got a new diver this morning,” remarked
the captain of the <i>Dawn</i>. “George
the Greek. He’s broke, and has to work.
I wish I’d got him myself: he’s a rare fine
diver.”</p>

<p>The Marquis and I looked at each other,
and there was uneasiness in our faces. The
<i>Dawn</i> rolled steadily on a long, windless
swell like watered silk; the sappy, luscious
green of the island forests rose up beyond
the sea; in the near foreground, the <i>Gertrude</i>,
with stern pointed toward us, showed
two gray spider-threads dropping down into
the water. At the ends of those two threads,
far down among the coral and the sponges
and the beds of weed and shell, crept all
along at the bottom of the sea two men,
one with the ransom of a king hung round
his neck, the other....</p>

<p>What was the other doing?</p>

<p>I did not mean to be very long finding
out.</p>

<p>“Run us up as close to the <i>Gertrude</i> as
you can, without interfering,” I said.</p>

<p>The captain worked a little nearer.
“That’s about as far as I can go,” he said.
“And now I’m going to send my diver down.
You and his lordship can see everything
beautiful. It’s not too deep here—since
that Mo got finished off with diver’s paralysis
the other day, we’ve shifted to shallower
water; this isn’t more than twelve
fathom.”</p>

<p>“Your diver isn’t going down just yet,”
I said, bending down to unlace my boots.
“I’m going. I want to have a look at
things.”</p>

<p>“It’s a loss to me,” said the captain
sourly. “Are you prepared to make it
good?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” declared the Marquis, who
seemed to understand the state of affairs.
“We will pay you what is the value of the
shell that your diver should bring up.”</p>

<p>“And what about the pearls?” demanded
the captain.</p>

<p>“Oh, come off it!” I said. “How many
pearls has the whole fleet got since it went
to work here?”</p>

<p>“Uncommon few, and bad at that,” admitted
the captain gloomily. “And what
there is, no doubt the Malays and Japs
poach for the most part.”</p>

<p>“Had any stealing?” I asked. I was
getting myself into the diver’s heavy suit
of woolen underwear now as quickly as I
could.</p>

<p>“You’ve been down before, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” (I did not think it necessary to
say that my experiences had been confined
to a single trip, made in shallow water, for
two or three minutes, over at Thursday,
and that I had not liked it a little bit.)
“About that stealing, now?”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon the Greek has some idea
of the kind, by the way he was keepin’
round after that Papuan diver, followin’
him along the street, and watchin’ him like
a cat watches a mouse.”</p>

<p>“And do you think the Papuan has been
stealing?” I had got into the woolens
now, and the tender, a Malay, came forward
to help me into the dress itself.</p>

<p>“Naw! Papuans aren’t no pearl-stealers.
They’ll steal food, or clothes, or tools, but
pearls—they haven’t no use for them, and
they’re not sharp enough to smuggle and
sell them.”</p>

<p>I had learned almost as much as I wanted
now. The rest, though I did not hear it
from Joe Gilbert till later, I will tell here.
The Greek had “shadowed” the Papuan
down to the boat, on which both were
engaged. He had got close to him during
the run out, and tried to examine the curio-bag
that the Papuan carried round his neck.
Most of the natives disliked and distrusted
the Greek, and Mo’s brother was not likely
to feel any kindness toward the white man
who had dug up and maltreated the body
of his only relative. He drew away and
refused to let the Greek put a finger on his
bag.</p>

<p>The Greek pretended that he had been
only jesting, and let him alone till they
arrived over the pearling grounds. Then
the two descended together, from opposite
sides of the vessel. When we came up they
had been alone in the depths of the sea for
over an hour.</p>

<p>Our captain noted the length of time the
divers had been under, and talked self-righteously
about the carelessness of “Good
Joe Gilbert.”</p>

<p>“He had them down long before we was
in sight,” said our skipper. “Bring along
that corselet, Tanjong. Give me a wrench.
I see to things myself on my ship, I do.”
(He began screwing me into my dress by
means of the wrench, talking all the time.)
“And look at them tenders of Gilbert’s—pre-tenders,
I call them. Are they watching
the air-tubes proper, or are they
not?”</p>

<p>I really did not know enough to say.</p>

<p>The captain went on: “Now I’ll tend
you myself, and you’ll be as safe as if you
was in the hotel in Samarai, drinkin’ a long
beer. You know the signals?”</p>

<p>“I know one pull on the signal-line is
‘pull me up,’ and I know how to work the
taps in the helmet. I reckon that’s
enough.” They were putting on my lead-soled
boots now and hanging a huge locket
of lead round my neck. I can not express
how I hated the idea of going down.</p>

<p>And the Marquis, sitting on the hatch,
his large pink face standing out like a
harvest moon against the heaving sea, was
whistling—of all tunes on earth—the Dead
March in “Saul.” By this, I guessed that
his thoughts were somber.</p>

<p>“Marky,” I said, “if you could choose
some other tune I’d be obliged to you.”</p>

<p>“It was not on the cause of you that I
whistled it,” he replied gloomily. “It is
on the cause of myself, who can not make
this journey, because I am too large that
any diver dress can take me in.”</p>

<p>“Well, one of us has got to go,” I said,
knotting the life-line round my waist.
The captain had moved off to inspect the
working of the pump.</p>

<p>“And of a truth!” cried the Marquis,
“the pitcher that goes to the well is soonest
mended!”</p>

<p>Tanjong now came with the front glass
to screw up my helmet. I looked round at
the <i>Gertrude</i> once more. Still the two spider
threads dangled down her counter, across
the littered, dangerous deck, with its careless
tenders and the empty, heaving swell
of the silent sea.</p>

<p>“They’ve been down too long—every
one must be asleep on that mud-scow of
Gilbert’s,” growled the captain. “Maybe
something’s got them. I near forgot to
tell you: you keep your eyes skinned for
clams, down below there.”</p>

<p>“Clams?”</p>

<p>“Yes—you don’t need to worry about
sharks: we haven’t seen one, not for days;
and as for diamond-fish, if they come along
and get a hold of your air-tube, it’s no use
you or any one worryin’. But them clams,
they are dangerous. There’s some proper
big ones, and if you put your foot in
one——-”</p>

<p>“I can guess,” I said; for I knew something
of the terrible giant tridacna of these
southern seas. “I’m ready: screw up.”</p>

<p>The Marquis had of course waited for this
moment to make a speech—when I could
not possibly hear him, being shut into my
metal shell like a lobster into its carapace—and
he rushed forward to seize and press
my hand, as I stepped over the side of the
lugger to the ladder below. He spoke eloquently
and I judged imprudently; and
tears rose in his eyes. I cut short the scene
by sliding my feet off the ladder and letting
myself go.</p>

<p>I feared the effect of such a depth as
seventy feet of water on an inexperienced
diver like myself; but I need not have been
uneasy. The skipper of the <i>Dawn</i> was not
minded to have an accident, and he let me
down very slowly. I saw the green water,
full of silver air-bubbles, rushing up and
past the window of my helmet, for what
seemed quite a long while—though it could
not have been more than a minute or two
before my lead-soled boots came down as
lightly as a dancer’s sandal on the crumbling
coral at the bottom.</p>

<p>This was the real thing, and not like my
amateur experiment at Thursday: I began
to feel interested and to forget the shrinking
fear that all new divers experience in leaving
the light and life of the world above and
trusting themselves, cased in benumbing
metal and rubber, to the choking depths of
the sea. My ears were very painful, and
my lungs worked badly; my arms and legs
seemed to move with a deliberation of their
own, and the curious change in the conditions
of gravity made me feel like a large
cork doll.</p>

<p>But I could make my way about, and it
was almost as light as on the surface. I
could see the tiny blue and emerald and
violet buds on the coral, and the eyes of the
painted parrot-fish, and every blade and
frond of the tall green seaweeds that waved
about as I moved by. The whole scene was
so wonderfully beautiful that I almost
forgot the grim errand that had brought me
down into the midst of it.</p>

<p>Coral beds, when you see them from the
surface on a calm day, are like a garden of
flowers below the water. Seen from beneath
the ocean itself, they take on the hues of
actual jewels: the huge fans and mushrooms
and ferns of the reef glow with
lights of emerald, sapphire, and amethyst;
the sun that falls through the water makes
magical fires of gold and green. Fish come
gently past the windows of your helmet,
hurrying not at all, and look in with their
cold eyes as they go by; their bodies shine
with all the colors of a painted butterfly,
and they make broken little rainbows in
the water as they move.</p>

<p>You are walking on the coral: it crumbles
away like over-baked biscuits under your
boots and keeps you slipping and staggering,
and you must keep a sharp lookout over
those ugly indigo-colored gulfs that open
in its surface here and there, for coral reefs
shelter many a dangerous guest.</p>

<p>All this I saw, treading with the long,
soft pace of the diver at the bottom of the
sea, breathing short with the weight of the
seventy feet above me, and trying not to
think about the invisible nails that kept
boring into my ears. I had taken my bearings
when I dropped down from the lugger,
and I could see her now far above me, like
a shadowy whale basking on the surface.
A good way ahead I could dimly discern
another shadow—that of the <i>Gertrude</i>. So
far, not a sign of her divers.</p>

<p>I trod on, balancing with my hands like
an acrobat as I passed the edges of deep
crevasses in the coral, and watching carefully
for the serrated double edge that
marks the presence of the formidable <i lang="la">Tridacna
gigas</i>—the huge shell that most people
have seen in museums, from three to
six or seven feet long, and as heavy as the
great stone basin of a fountain in a park.
Small ones I saw everywhere; bigger ones,
a foot or two in length, now and then.
But none of the giants was to be seen.</p>

<p>I must have been down fully ten minutes
and was beginning to feel the effects of my
submersion, in a certain giddiness of the
head and numbness of the limbs, when I
saw something a good way in front of me
that was not rock, nor coral, nor fish.
What it was I could not tell, for it was in
rapid motion and agitated the water so
much that one could only see something
waving and bending about. I took a good
grip of my ax and went on faster. Be it
what it might, I had got to have a look
at it.</p>

<p>The water seemed to clear as I drew
nearer, and then I began to run—as one
runs at the bottom of the sea, sprawling
and waving and half swimming, working
arms and legs together. For now I saw.
There were two divers a little way ahead,
attached spiderwise to their ship by long
threads of life-line and air-tube, and they
were fighting. I floundered up close to
them and they never saw me; hear me they
could not, for we were all isolated in our
metal shells one from the other.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->


<p>It was awful to see them struggling and
reeling and gripping at each other—there
at the bottom of the sea, where a tangled
life-line or a nipped air-tube meant certain
death. The silence—the muffled, stifled
silence of the deep—made the horror more
horrible yet. It was like a struggle of lost
souls among the shades.</p>

<p>I made my way as close as I dared, keeping
my life-line and air-tube well out of the
way, and snatched at the arm of the nearest
diver. But in the unfamiliar medium of the
water I missed; and the fight went on, the
two dark monsters, with their round metal
heads and hideous huge glass eyes, dodging,
slipping, striking.... I saw now, with a
thrill of horror, that both were using their
knives, or trying to. They had an immense
advantage over me, in being accustomed to
the water; they moved easily where I could
hardly stir for fear of losing my balance.
Something, however, had to be done. I
flung myself forward anyhow, and made
another snatch at the reeling figures.
Crunch went the coral under my feet, and
I went down right into the black crevasse.</p>

<p>I caught my signal-line, and hauled as I
fell. They were doing their duty upon the
<i>Dawn</i>: my tender answered with a sturdy
haul that sent me swinging toward the surface
again. I signaled “Lower,” and they
let me down. But the swing had carried
me a little way from the scene of the fight.</p>

<p>With a horrible fear thumping at my
heart, I flapped and stumbled forward
through the wavering green.... I was
too late.</p>

<p>The biggest diver had got one home at
last. As I came up he sheathed his knife
in the dress of the other and ripped it up;
out came a fearful rush of silvery air, and
the wretched creature, drowning, kicked
and struggled, and snatched wildly at its
signal-line, which I now saw had been cut.</p>

<p>The other man drove his hand into the
gap in the dress, tore out a small brown
object dangling on a string, and jumped
backward out of the way of his grasping,
struggling victim. In the jump he fell, and
instantly the water vibrated to an iron
clang that struck my helmet like a shot.
He was caught in something; he fought
terribly to be loose; from his imprisoned
arm spread out a sudden cloud of brilliant
red.</p>

<p>“Sharks! Blood brings sharks!” was the
thought that beat upon my brain, as I
flapped forward to give him help. Dulled
as my senses were by the pressure of the
sea, what I saw nearly drove me out of my
mind with horror. A tridacna had got him.</p>

<p>It was set in a hole of the coral, its two
fearful zigzag edges lying almost even with
the surrounding level. It had been gaping
open until the diver fell back upon it, and
the clang that had struck upon my helmet
was the sound of its ponderous shells, each
some quarter ton in weight, slamming shut.
The arm of the diver had been snapped and
crushed between the edges: even as I
looked, he fell back, the last rag of flesh
tearing away. The tridacna had nipped
off the limb like a carrot.</p>

<p>By this time I was so dazed and giddy
with my submersion that I scarcely knew
what I was about, and the horror of the two
deaths before my eyes did not overcome me
as it might have done had I been able to
feel anything clearly. I knew the small
man must be drowned: I guessed that the
other was beyond help. I caught at the
bigger man’s signal-line, knotted it together,
and tugged furiously. Up on the <i>Gertrude</i>
they felt it and began to haul. The two
black monsters, with their gleaming eyes,
went slowly up toward the shadow of the
boat, dangling loose and limp as they rose.</p>

<p>“Sharks!” my mind kept saying to me.
I looked fearfully round and round. The
green wavering water was clear of all large
shadows: no living torpedo, snout down,
darted between me and the daylight. At
my feet the serrated jaws of the terrible
clam jutted slightly up from the coral cleft
in which it lay; they were closed like a vise,
and an end of shattered bone protruded
from the middle.</p>

<p>I have always wondered that I was able
to think as quickly and as clearly as I did,
there at the bottom of the sea, with my
mind dazed by unaccustomed pressure and
shaken by the horrible tragedy that had
just passed before my eyes. But I was
quite certain of what I had to do. It was
the Greek’s right arm that had been severed.
The diamond, in its casing of grass,
was in his hand as he fell. A thousand to
one that diamond was inside the tridacna.
I had got to get it out, and quickly—for
two reasons—first, I could not stay down
much longer, and secondly, nothing but a
miracle could have kept the sharks away
so long, with the smell of blood in the
water.</p>

<p>The tridacna had been open when I
came up. It would probably open again,
as the morsel it had caught was scarcely
in accordance with its ordinary food. When
it opened, I must be ready with my ax, and
strike as deep as possible into the yielding
flesh, in the hope of hitting the great muscle
that controlled the swinging of the valves.
Should I miss that, I stood to lose the diamond,
the ax, and not impossibly myself,
for those giant shells as they closed might
grab me as they had the Greek.</p>

<p>Well, I must hope not to miss. I poised
the ax, and waited.</p>

<p>It must have been several minutes before
any movement took place in the tridacna,
but at last I saw the least possible gaping
between the rows of tight-clinched scallops.
The shells moved apart, slowly, slowly.
Something gleamed between their separating
edges—something that shot out rays
of blue and green.</p>

<p>Was it the diamond? No! It was the
tridacna itself.</p>

<p>Much as I had heard of these creatures,
I had never heard anything of their beauty,
and when I first saw it, it almost stunned
me. From out the gates of those gigantic
shells, as they opened more and more, came
pouring forth the “mantle” of the fish,
rising high above the marble edges of the
shell, and trembling away in a cloud of
glory several feet beyond. All the colors
of a peacock flaunting in the sun were there:
purples, violets, gold and green and blue,
and, over all, the iridescent haze of the
water, breaking into crumbled rainbows
upon this miracle of unknown, unseen
beauty.</p>

<p>I fairly gasped, it was so wonderful.
Then, remembering myself, I bent as near
the shell as I dared and looked for the
ghastly relic it had seized. There was nothing
to be seen but the gorgeous mantle
itself. The murderous hand and its booty
had alike disappeared.</p>

<p>I waited for a moment to collect myself,
felt the blade of the ax to see that it was
keen, poised it, and swung.</p>

<p>“Now or never!” I thought. And, as the
blade went home, I leaped back, and stiffened
myself for the shock of the great
valves slamming down on the handle.</p>

<p>It did not come.</p>

<p>I tried to draw the ax out and could not.
The tridacna, in its dying agony, had
gripped its muscles round the blade. But
the closing-muscle was severed: the valves
could not shut. Or at least I thought so.
I drew my diver’s knife and took the risk
of putting my hand inside the shells, slashing
away at the huge mass of meat inside.
By degrees the mechanical grip on the ax-blade
lessened and I pulled it out.</p>

<p>Now it was possible to empty the clam,
and I began tearing the meat away in
lumps as big as butchers’ joints, and flinging
it down on the coral. The whiteness
of the inner shell, pure as polished marble,
began to shine through. I had thrown
away the greater part of the contents when
I came at last on what I sought.</p>

<p>There it was, the little brown parcel,
lying loose beside the greedy hand that
had clutched at it and at death together.
It seemed to me, as I took the Sorcerer’s
Stone and put it in the bag round my
neck, as if a wave of cold passed through
me that had nothing to do with the benumbing
water in which I stood. The
evil thing!—the thing that had caused
death before, that would assuredly cause
it again. There, at the bottom of the
sea, it would have been safe: the trail of
blood that marks the path of every great
diamond would have been washed away
in the safe, the secret waves, to begin
never more again. And I was taking it
back.</p>

<p>I declare I stood with the stone in my
hand and thought—I do not know what
I thought: something mad, if madness it
be to think as other men do not. Whether
I should have gone beyond thinking or not
I can not say. I did not get the chance.
For, just as I had taken the diamond out
of my bag, something happened that made
me drop it back again in frantic haste and
tug at my signal-cord as hard as I could.
Not hurriedly, but quietly, softly, and
almost gracefully, a large, long, deep-blue
form came gliding through the water,
and, with a sweep of its scythe-shaped
tail, made straight for me.</p>

<p>I believe now that it was going simply
for the remains of the tridacna and was
not troubling about me at all: I could not
have smelt so attractive, cased up in metal
and rubber, as did the raw scattered flesh.
But nobody waits to try conclusions with
a shark in its own element. I went up
through the water as fast as the captain
of the <i>Dawn</i> could drag me, alarmed, as he
was, at my long stay, and I felt that shark
at my toes every inch of the seventy feet.</p>

<p>Nothing touched me, however. The
hull of the <i>Dawn</i> appeared above my head—a
welcome sight, indeed; the ladder
flashed before my eyes, and then two pairs
of hands were pulling me over the bulwarks
and screwing away at the glasses on my
helmet. I am not of the fainting kind,
but I will admit I had to sit down while
they were doing it, and was not very clear
as to my whereabouts for a moment or
two after.</p>

<p>Then, when they had got the helmet off,
and my lungs were full of the good, fresh
air—the glorious air of free heaven itself—I
saw that the Marquis was kneeling on the
deck beside me to get his head on a level
with mine, and gazing so anxiously into
my face that I could not help bursting out
into laughter.</p>

<p>“Grace to God, you are well!” said the
Marquis, his face lighting up like sunshine
after rain. “You signaled ‘all right’ when we
pulled, but, my friend, we was near bringing
you up at force! Did we not see that the two
divers of the <i>Gertrude</i> had come up sick?”</p>

<p>“Sick!” I yelled. “Dead!”</p>

<p>“Dead!” cried the Marquis and the
captain together.</p>

<p>“Why!” the captain declared, “that
<i>Gertrude</i>, she up sailed and off with her
before they was well on board.”</p>

<p>So she had; there was no vestige of her
to be seen. It appeared afterward that
Good Joe Gilbert had completely lost his
head at the sight of his two divers, one
obviously murdered, the other dead and
mutilated, and had started off as hard as
he could for the magistrate and the police
on Samarai. This job was too much for
him to handle, he said, and he didn’t want
to get his head into no murdering rows and
have the Government jumping on a harmless
man that only wanted to do well by
every one.</p>

<p>It was to his panic haste that I owed
my freedom to carry out my own plans,
there at the bottom of the sea. Had the
Marquis or the captain realized that Gilbert’s
divers were dead they would have
pulled me up at once. But divers’ paralysis
had been common in the fleet, and they
took the disturbance on the <i>Gertrude</i> to
mean nothing worse, as her flag, in the
confusion, had not been half-masted.</p>

<p>The Marquis and I discussed afterward
whether the Greek could have known or
not that Mo’s brother had a diamond on
his ugly little person. I inclined to think
that he did not. In a pearling fleet the
minds of men run exclusively on pearls,
and nobody, so far as I knew, had said
anything about diamonds at any time.
The acute little Greek had somehow sensed
the existence of a small and precious valuable
in which we were interested; he had
shadowed the Papuan to try and find out
what he could, and, being baffled, had
taken service on the <i>Gertrude</i> for the sole
purpose (or so I judged) of following Mo’s
brother beneath the water and robbing
him, there where no man was likely to see
or interfere.</p>

<p>I do not think it ever entered his head
that a stranger, not a diver by profession,
would risk the descent in twelve fathoms
of dangerous water merely on the chance
of seeing what he was up to. But then,
he did not know the stake.</p>

<p>Or so I thought. The Marquis had his
own opinion.</p>

<p>He had his own opinion about the diamond,
too. That night we ventured, very
cautiously, to take it out and examine it in
a quiet corner. He handled its beauty—our
own at last—with a touch that was
almost reluctant.</p>

<p>“Flint, now that it is to us, I do not feel
as I have felt about it before,” he said.
“I hope these misfortunes are at an end.”</p>

<p>“Well, you wanted it badly enough;
you should be glad now we have it,” I
said.</p>

<p>“Distant fields are always green,” quoted
the Marquis gravely; and I was so amazed
to hear him quote a proverb right side up
for once that I almost dropped the diamond
on the floor.</p>

<h4>
THE SECRET OF THE STONE OVEN COUNTRY<br>
</h4>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> Marquis and I sat on the hot
black sand of Kara Bay and tried
to realize that we were shipwrecked.</p>

<p>It was not easy. There was the calm,
blue, burning sea in front of us, there was
the ruffle of foam on the coral reef a mile
or two out from the beach. There were the
sea-hawks hovering and veering just as
they had been doing an hour or two ago,
when we had left the little coastal steamer
for a stroll on shore while some small
trouble in the engine room was repaired.
And there—was not—the <i>Waiwera</i>. With
our own eyes we had seen her get under
steam again, start to make a little closer
in shore before putting out her boat to
fetch us off, strike the ill-charted reef bow
on, and go down in the deep water outside
like a tin can that fills and sinks in a well.</p>

<p>It was so quick that they had not even
time to sling the boat out. The reef, with
its long knife edges, had ripped her open
from end to end. She was overloaded with
ore from a new mine near Samarai. She
was a crank little boat at best, and as for
water-tight compartments, you might as
soon have expected electric light, or cold
storage, or a satinwood grand piano made
to turn into a high altar for Sunday services—such
as they have on the western ocean
liners. There were no frills of any kind
about the <i>Waiwera</i>. When she hit, she
went down and made no fuss about it.</p>

<p>The Marquis and I saw the whole thing,
there on the beach two miles away. We
heard the rattle of the engines as they broke
loose and plunged when she up-ended. We
heard the piteous cry, thin and faint with
distance, that rose to an unpitying heaven,
as the decks went under water. After
that there was nothing any more, just the
blue sea, and the burning sky, and the
circling and hovering bronze sea-hawks,
busy with their fishing again.</p>

<p>“Is it real?” asked the Marquis, his
hands flat on the sand, supporting his huge
body, his eyes staring, like the fixed eyes of
a doll, out to the empty sea. “Flint, what
shall a man say when he sees a thing like
that? This is a devil of a country, where
one may see twenty men encounter death
out there at one’s eyes and sit and look as
calm as this! My Flint, if I am mad, then
you are it also, because you have no
emotion no more than me.”</p>

<p>“We’re neither of us mad, or bad either,”
I said. “We’ll be sorry enough when we’ve
had time to realize that poor old Tommy
Gregg is gone, and Jensen and the rest;
but we’re shipwrecked ourselves, and in a
bit of a fix, Marky, and that’s going to take
all our thinking for some time.”</p>

<p>“Where are we?” asked the Marquis,
looking round. It was not a pretty bit of
scenery. Kara Bay is the sort of place a
man might go to die in if he felt like it,
but it is not the sort of place any one would
ever want to live in. As a matter of fact,
no one ever has.</p>

<p>The bay is like a black-lip shell, in curve
and in color. The sand is like powdered
cinder to look at, and as hot as the innocent-looking
iron door of a furnace, to feel.
Behind comes a belt of poisonous painty-green
low bush; behind that again, forest,
so dark and tangled that it looks black
even at midday. The whole place has a
deadly, fungoid sort of look, as if it had
sprung up in a night out of the heat and
rain and general decay, and never had been
or could be natural and normal in its
growth.</p>

<p>I knew where we were well enough, and
did not like the knowledge. The <i>Waiwera</i>,
on her voyage to join a North-German
Lloyd boat at Wilhemshafen, ran along a
lonely and unfrequented coast; and the
loneliest, most unfrequented and most generally
undesirable bit was the bit where the
Marquis and I had been marooned—here,
in Kara Bay, with a suit of clothes apiece,
two revolvers, a few dozen cartridges, two
tins of meat and a paper bag of biscuits.</p>

<p>The Marquis, of course, did not quite
understand how bad a fix we were in. I
did, and I had no time to spare for anything
but consideration of our case.</p>

<p>Kara Bay is a hundred miles or more
from anywhere along the coast. The sea-line
is precipitous thereabouts; there is no
easy beach to follow, as in the western
country. A boat is your only chance.
But when you have no boat?</p>

<p>The Kara River runs into the sea close
at hand. It comes from the Kiloki Range,
a rampart of rock and forest eleven thousand
feet high. It is a succession of rapids and
falls. I knew all about the Kara River:
no help there.</p>

<p>Behind the Kiloki Range you strike down
towards country that is at least known if
not inhabited. There is a Government
station there. I calculated it to be something
like sixty miles away from us in a
direct line—a fortnight’s journey over
those mountains if we were lucky. It
seemed to be the Kiloki Range or nothing.
We wanted about forty carriers with food
and tents and trade goods, and we wanted
maps and field-glasses and compasses, and
rifles and shotguns and ammunition, to
take the journey as most people in Papua
take such trips. But as we were not likely
to get any of these things on the black-sand
beach of Kara Bay, it was up to us
to try what we could do without them;
or else stop there and die.</p>

<p>That was what I told the Marquis, not
exaggerating the seriousness of our situation,
but not making little of it. He
listened patiently and sighed. I really do
not think any one, even a man who knew
him as I did, could have anticipated what
he would reply.</p>

<p>“Flint, my very good friend,” he said,
twisting both ends of his mustache at
once, “that which I chiefly regret in the
affair is that it shall now be so many weeks
that we shall see no white woman. And
look, on the Norddeutscher Lloyd, we
should in three or four days have been
sitting on the feet of many beautiful
ladies, and they should have said politenesses—what
do you say?—smooged us
greatly, because of the horrors we have
encountered. I regret to lose that. Also,
I begin to feel that this sacred pig of a
diamond has made us enough adventure
already.”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose it was the Sorcerer’s
Stone sunk the <i>Waiwera</i>?” I said.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I think it’s confoundedly
likely,” said the Marquis, putting up
his hand to the string that ran round his
fat neck. “She brought us adventure,
yes, adventure, that diamond, and she
brings us more. And Flint, my friend,
there comes the time, after all, when the
rolling stone maketh the heart sick. Don’t
you think it?”</p>

<p>“I reckon this isn’t just the time to
think it, if I do,” I said. “We may get
through this, and we mayn’t, Marky.”</p>

<p>“Is it so bad as that?”</p>

<p>“Just so bad,” I said.</p>

<p>The Marquis looked out at the sea, lying
blue and calm above our late companions’
grave. He then produced a large, white
silk handkerchief embroidered with a coronet
at the corner, spread it between his
two hands and deliberately began to shed
tears.</p>

<p>I was long past being astonished at
anything that he might do. I watched
him, reasonably certain that my statement
of our difficulties had nothing to do with
his emotion. He cried quite simply and
unaffectedly for a minute or two. Then
he stopped, wiped his eyes and face with
the handkerchief and said:</p>

<p>“I have wept them who died. I am
finished. Lead on.” Adding as an afterthought:
“It is a magnificent embroidery
on that handkerchief. It was made for me
by a little beautiful who loved me. Shall
I tell you of her?”</p>

<p>“I’d be delighted, another time,” I
answered. “Just now, we have to think
of how we’re ever going to get back again
to the ‘beautifuls’ who love us both.
Marky, you and I have got to get up and
travel right now. Do you see those mountains
up there?”</p>

<p>“That range of enchanting beauty? Yes.”</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll go on thinking it beautiful.
We’ve got to cross it before we die of starvation
or fever. Our lunch that we brought
from the steamer is going to last us a good
while.”</p>

<p>“We will depart at once,” said the Marquis,
lifting his huge bulk lightly enough
from the ground and drawing himself up
like a soldier on parade. “March!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was the wild pig, I think, that saved
our lives—and at the same time nearly
caused their loss.</p>

<p>We were three days from the beach,
well up into the Kiloki Range, but almost
broken down with hardship and short
commons, when we chanced upon the brute
in a gully, and shot it with our revolvers.
We cut it up and set a leg to roast; the
savory smell spread far into the forest;
and, as we soon had reason to know, ours
were not the only nostrils that perceived
it.</p>

<p>When the leg was done, we stuffed. No
food could be carried far in that climate,
and the more we ate, the less we lost. We
were both greasy with the richness of the
meat; our hands were slippery, our faces
shining, and, I think, our hearts felt
stouter than they had done for the last
forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>“Another one, my Flint; make hay while
the iron is hot,” counseled the Marquis,
filling his own mouth to speechlessness.
He was sitting opposite me as he spoke,
and I saw his face grow suddenly swelled;
the eyes started out, the cheeks became
puffy.... At first I thought he was
choking; then I guessed he was trying to say
something; then I knew that he had seen
something and I turned round like a shot.</p>

<p>Behind us, looking, as savages in the bush
always do, just as if they had grown there
instead of arriving, were ten or a dozen
ugly-looking heads standing quite still in
the underbrush. The tips of a number
of spears showed up in the tangled green
beside them. They were an unpleasant
crew; their foreheads sloped enormously,
making them look scarcely human; their
hair was trained in greasy curls that fell
far back and increased the beast-like angle
of the face. Their black and white eyes
looked steadily at us out of their brown
faces, and the look was that of savage man,
near, yet ten thousand æons of evolution
distant. Across the gulf, what thought
could travel?</p>

<p>We got up on our feet at once, and I
spoke to the men in half a dozen different
languages—all the New Guinea tongues
I knew anything of—hoping to find some
means of communication. I was lucky
enough to hit on one at last. When I got
down to the Mambare tongue, one of the
faces showed signs of intelligence; the
others remained blank.</p>

<p>I explained that we were great chiefs who
had lost our way; that our ship had sunk
and that we desired to go to the Government
station on the other side of the range.
If the men would guide us there, I said,
the Government would give them any
amount of treasure—salt, tobacco, knives
and tomahawks, calico cloth.</p>

<p>The interpreter spoke to the others.
They seemed dissatisfied, but they came
out of the brush into the clearing and we
were able to see them.</p>

<p>“Marky,” I said, “we’ve got to keep our
eyes skinned; these seem to be Koiroros,
and they’re among the worst cannibals
in New Guinea. Probably they’ve never
seen white men before up here; it’s all
unexplored country.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose we shall be eat?”
asked the Marquis.</p>

<p>“Not necessarily. Cannibals aren’t
always eating other people. We may be
able to make friends and get them to guide
us.”</p>

<p>With a view to this, I collected any
little trifles we could spare—a tin match-box,
a silk tie, a small penknife—and offered
them to the tallest man, who seemed, by
his demeanor, to be something of a
chief.</p>

<p>He was a splendidly made fellow, quite
naked save for a bark waist-cloth, and all
hung over with shell and dog’s tooth
ornaments. I looked anxiously for any
trade beads in his jewelry, but didn’t
see any, nor had any of the party steel
knives or tomahawks. They were armed,
besides the spears, with stone-headed clubs
and long daggers made of human thigh-bone.
It seemed plain that they had had
no dealings with civilized men; and this
was so much the worse for us.</p>

<p>The chief seemed pleased with the gifts,
and said something to the man who could
speak Mambare. It appeared that he
wanted us to come to his village, which
was only a little way off. He said that
he would give us guides; but I noticed
that he looked at the ground as he spoke
and did not face us.</p>

<p>“We had better go,” I told the Marquis.
“I don’t like making friends with natives
as a rule; nine times out of ten it’s a
mistake—but want of tucker gives us no
choice. We’ll try and get carriers there,
and some yams to take us on.”</p>

<p>The way proved to be very much longer
than we expected, but, tired as we both
were, the sight of the village aroused us
when it came into view. It was certainly
one of the strangest things I had seen,
even in strange New Guinea.</p>

<p>We were now in the midst of the high
ranges, and there was no level anywhere—not
so much as one could use to lay out a
tennis ground. Every hill clasped hands
with the next; torrents, foaming white
and furious among the ferny green, cut
up the ranges into a gigantic pattern of
“ridge and furrow.” The mountains nudged
and crowded one another; their shoulders,
their hips, their elbows were massed like
the shoulders, hips and elbows of a human
crowd. The peaks ran up into needle
points like incredible pictures in geography
books; they stuck out battlements, roofs
and buttresses into empty air; they sloped
at every angle, into every shape. It was
the world run through a chopping machine
and thrown out at random. And in this
place, without a spot where you could
set down the sole of your foot in comfort,
men lived who had not wings!</p>

<p>The village crowned the impossibility of
the scene. It was exactly like a clump of
enormous brown toadstools, and it was
bracketed—one could not say set—on to
the sides of a needle-point peak more
like a church spire than anything else.
The houses were mere semicircular roofs
of thatch, placed upon bamboo floors that
were stuck to the mountain by piles in
some incomprehensible fashion. Up the
peak of this amazing place we were guided
by the Koiroros, who kept unpleasantly
close about us and seemed resolved that
we should not get away from them. As
nothing unprovided with wings could have
got away from the mountain men in their
own country, we did not think of trying,
even though it began to be unpleasantly
clear that we were in reality not employers
of these people, but prisoners.</p>

<p>The Koiroros began to sing as they
approached their homes, chanting loudly
and triumphantly, with an indescribable
undertone of something that—as we understand
the word—was not human; something
that harked back the ages very near
to them and very far from us.</p>

<p>The Marquis heard it too. Tired as he
was, he managed to gasp out as we toiled
up the frightful slope:</p>

<p>“Flint, if you desire a proof that this
Darwin of yours had reason, listen then—listen
to the wild beast howling over its
preys!”</p>

<p>“We aren’t going to be any prey,”
I snapped, being a little cross with fatigue.
“And anyhow, the less you talk, the better.
They can guess a lot from one’s tone.”</p>

<p>But I must say, when we got into the
village itself, onto the slope that seemed
to take the place of its Plaza, or Place
Royale, or Unter den Linden, I began to
feel that we were in a tighter place than I
had thought. For I saw something that I
had not quite expected to see.</p>

<p>Dug out in the side of the hill and lined
with neatly fitted stones, were certain
long, coffin-like holes that I knew at once
for the stone ovens of the main range
people. They seemed to be nearly six
feet in length. Now there is only one kind
of game that needs a stone oven six feet
long to bake it in—man.</p>

<p>Of course, the greater number of Papuan
inland tribes are cannibals now and then.
I was accustomed to that sort of thing, and
had even seen human joints made ready for
cooking—not, of course, the killing of the
game, which I shouldn’t have allowed for a
moment. But cannibalism, among most
of the tribes, is not at all an every-day
affair; it is the sequel of a big, victorious
raid or the end of some unusually bitter
private quarrel.</p>

<p>There are tribes, however, who eat man
whenever and wherever they get the chance;
and it is those tribes who go to the trouble
of building big stone ovens, especially
designed for cooking human beings. That
is why I was not too well pleased to find
that we had got into the Stone Oven country
without expecting it. I wondered if we
should ever get out again. I trusted a good
deal to our revolvers: firearms will go far
among men who have never seen them—but
the mountain tribes are good fighters,
for Papuans, and I did not anticipate that
it would be easy to get away, if we had
occasion to try it.</p>

<p>They led us into the largest house of the
village, a ramshackle shanty of a place,
with spears and shields hung up on the
walls and bamboo shelves to sleep on. It
smelled of unwashed nigger, old hay, damp
and rain; and you could see the mountain
clouds curling and wreathing, through the
splits in the crazy floor—very much of the
house projecting right out over nothing at
all.</p>

<p>Down the hill, like ants coming out of the
top of a tall ants’-nest, ran the people of
the place, yelling with excitement at our
arrival. They had not a stitch of clothes
among the lot; even the women were
dressed merely in a few small land-shells
strung round the neck and a handful of
dogs’ teeth fastened like tassels into the
hair.</p>

<p>“When we shall leave this place,”
remarked the Marquis, “I will take with
me a complete costume of one of these
women, to carry in my purse all the time,
so that I may show it to the delightful
English misses when I go to London, and
hear them say, ‘Oooh, shocking!’ That
is what they love to say, my Flint.”</p>

<p>He looked about the ugly crowd again.</p>

<p>“They are not natural, these people; I
do not love them,” he commented. “See,
then, how they are every one bended back
from the waist like a man who has a
tetanus fit, because of the climbing they
always do. When we go away from
here——”</p>

<p>He looked about again.</p>

<p>“If we go away from here,” he amended,
coolly, “you shall see that I will give a
lecture to the scientifics in Paris, a most
blooming learned lecture.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will, Marky,” I said. We
were sitting on the bamboo bed-place now,
smoking a little of our cherished tobacco
and wondering when or if the Koiroros
would give us something to eat. One of
the children—rather a pretty little chap of
toddling age, who had been half walking,
half crawling, on the verge of an appalling
precipice as we came up to the village—made
its way over to us and began touching
our clothes with childish curiosity.
The older people watched it, but did not
go near; they seemed shy of putting their
hands on us.</p>

<p>The Marquis, who was fond of children,
caressed the little thing and tried to
make friends with him (rather foolishly, I
thought) by taking the diamond out of the
case in which we carried it, and making it
flash. The child looked at it and then
retreated, at a call from his mother, striking
at the stone as he went. It dropped
and we both went after it with a hasty
exclamation, as the floor was full of holes.
I recovered it and fastened it up again in
its case with a bit of string.</p>

<p>“I’ll take my turn now, Marky,” I said,
hanging it around my neck. For we had
been carrying it day and day about, under
our clothes.</p>

<p>“Look!” said the Marquis, making a
small motion with his hand. I looked and
saw a Koiroro, whom I had not previously
noticed, literally glaring at me as I put the
stone away. He was by a good deal the
tallest man in the village, and he had a
very fine crown of bird-of-paradise feathers
on his head—among them the plumes of
the rare blue species that is worth almost
what you like to ask for it in civilization.
It was evident that he was a man of some
standing. I suspected him to be the village
sorcerer, as he had an ugly necklace
about his neck, made of locks of human
hair, strung alternately with some of the
small bones out of the ear, and supporting
a kind of trophy made of double
teeth.</p>

<p>“More trouble about the diamond,” I
said. “That city brute has a mind to get
it if he can. A sorcerer, I reckon.”</p>

<p>There was some murmuring among the
men, and they drew off into a corner of the
house by themselves, talking and looking
at us, especially at me. The inevitable
evening rain of the mountains was coming
down now in a waterfall rush; the purple
gorge beneath us, that we could see through
the open door, was filling up with a stormy
sea of white cloud. Without, precipices,
tree-tops, clouds and plunging steps, all
drenched in roaring rain; within, a gloomy,
damp-smelling house of rotten thatch, white
skulls gleaming through the dusk from the
place where they hung a-swing upon the
rafters; shadowy men-things, more than
half brute, glowering at us from their
corner.... And out upon the hill-side,
just a few yards away, the long stone
ovens—waiting.</p>

<p>No, it was not a pleasant prospect, take
it all in all.</p>

<p>For the moment, however, I thought
there was no actual danger. I have seen
much of the Papuan tribes, and it did not
seem to me that these Koiroros had the
blood-seeking mood on, that night.</p>

<p>“I don’t think they’ll attack just yet,”
I told the Marquis. “But I’d be as glad
if they hadn’t seen the stone. They’re
talking about it now.”</p>

<p>“What do they say?” asked the Marquis
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you that, but I can guess
they’re telling each other all about it.
I’d be willing to make a bet it’s known to
them. It must be one of the celebrated
sorcerer’s charms that go knocking about
all over the country, passed from one to
the other.”</p>

<p>“And they will try to get it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it and us.”</p>

<p>It grew darker in the chief-house, there
as we sat on the bamboo sleeping shelf,
listening to the unvarying roar of the rain
and watching the excited waving of the
head-plumes in the corner where the cannibals
held their conference—the plumes
were all we could see now, for a naked
Papuan becomes rapidly and completely
invisible, once it begins to grow dark. The
Marquis was very much quieter than usual,
but I do not think he was at all afraid.
I think he reckoned on having a fight
by-and-by, and liked the idea. As for
myself, well, a man with any sense isn’t
afraid in a tight place; it would be idiotic,
because you want all the nerve you have,
to get out of it. And usually you are much
too busy thinking what to do to worry
over what may happen if you don’t do it.</p>

<p>A <a id="chg1"></a>woman brought a torch in by and by,
and said something that caused great
excitement. The men jumped about and
clapped their hands and made noises
exactly like the noise a dog makes when it
sees its food in front of it. The Marquis
and I both had our hands ready upon our
revolver butts, but we needn’t have troubled—it
was only the pig that had already
had so much to do with our fortunes, coming
in again. They had been heating it
up and were bringing it in for supper.</p>

<p>We all sat down on the floor then—and
the meat was shared out, together with a
lot of sweet potatoes, hot from the ashes.
The cannibals gave us a liberal share and
offered us a bamboo full of water to drink
out of. They tore and gnawed their food
in a way that was not pleasant to watch—remembering
those long ovens on the hill.</p>

<p>“Sacred name of a camel, what a lecture
I will give!” sighed the Marquis, with his
mouth full of sweet potato. “Look at
their chests all blowed out with the climbing,
and their feet that have monkey toes,
and the cords on the insteps, and the nostril
of the pig that they have! See how
they jump, they flitter, they are all the
time nervous and distracted! That comes
of living on the edge of the cook-pot; if
you hold your finger up at one, and say
‘Hi!’ he should jump to break the floor.”</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t,” I said, looking
down at the velvet-black gulf of vacancy
that one could see between the slats of the
flooring. “Don’t you get too scientific,
Marky; I warn you, that nervousness of
theirs is a bad sign. Also, their friendliness
is a bad sign. Shove back and finish
your food with your shoulders against the
wall, if you take my advice.” I moved
over as I spoke and the Marquis followed
me.</p>

<p>We ate as men eat who do not know
where their next meal is to come from; we
filled our pockets quietly, when we could
swallow no more. The Koiroros were so
busy chattering among themselves that
they did not notice what we were doing.
They did not molest us, though I could
feel there was trouble in the air.</p>

<p>I cannot say we passed a pleasant night.
We kept watch in turns, and got some
sleep, through sheer fatigue, lying just
where we had eaten our meal, on the floor
of the chief-house. The cannibals were
sleeping all around us, snorting and snoring
like walruses. One of them lay across the
door, I noticed, and as it was hardly large
enough to crawl through, he guarded it
efficiently.</p>

<p>Towards four o’clock in the morning (I
found the time by feeling the hands of my
watch), the presentiment of coming trouble
got hold of me so completely that I resolved
to make an attempt at getting away, cost
what it might. The more I thought about
that liberal supper, the less I liked it. The
more I considered those long stone ovens
on the hill, the more likely I thought it
that they would be filled on the morrow—if
we did not get away.</p>

<p>I felt for the Marquis in the dark; it
was his turn to sleep, but he was not sleeping.
I put my mouth to his ear and
whispered a little. Then I got out my
knife and began cutting away the flimsy
bamboo flooring. It was the time of the
waning moon; I knew that we should have
light enough to see by, once we got outside,
and that it would last till dawn came up.
By dawn we might hope to be out of the
way.</p>

<p>It was easy enough to cut the floor without
waking the Koiroros, since all natives
are heavy sleepers, and these men had fed
full before they slept. Getting through
was more difficult; I gritted my teeth at
the creaking noise made by the Marquis’s
weight as he lowered himself after me.
Where I had cut through there was sloping
soil underneath; we got hold of the supporting
piles that were thrust into it, and
holding on by them, made our way very
cautiously down the precipice to the place
where the trees and lianas began once
more. The angle here was awful, but we
had plenty of hand-hold, and crept along
securely enough in the watery moonlight.
The rain was over now and the river far
below us at the bottom of the gorge roared
full-fed along its way.</p>

<p>Not a sound came from the toadstool
clump of houses above as we crept down the
precipice. We were out of earshot before
long, and able to speak as we mounted the
next great wall of rock, keeping always
in the direction of the far-off Government
station, which I now began to hope we
should reach. By the lay of the land, I
guessed we had forty miles or more to go,
and that might mean a week in this country
of precipices. Still, if we could find anything
to eat on the way, and if the Koiroros
did not recapture us, it was—just—possible
to get through.</p>

<p>Dawn, rising red through the tableland
of white cloud, like spilled blood spreading
on snow, came up and caught us sooner
than I liked. We were out of sight of the
village, having crossed two ridges, but our
position, climbing up the bare rock at the
side of a waterfall, was dangerously exposed
should any of the Koiroros be within sight.
I stopped where I was, on a ledge of stone
overgrown with white butterfly orchids,
and looked over the tossing billows of tree-tops
that lay behind. There was small
satisfaction in that. An army might have
been hidden in the bush, following us up.
Still—considering the speed the Koiroros
could keep up in this mountain country
when they chose—it certainly did look as
if they were not pursuing us. The Marquis
was jubilant.</p>

<p>“They are not spiritual, these people,”
he declared, scrambling like a cockroach in
my rear. “By gum! I think their mentality
is far back in the scale of evolution; they
are blessed idiots. They lock the stable
door when the milk is spilt. I can figure
how they are saying injuries to one another
about our invasion, now we are safe away.”</p>

<p>I did not say anything, for the reason
that I was not very sure we were safe away—yet.
There was something I did not understand
about this easy letting go. All the
same, there was only one thing to do—go
on as fast as possible, and we did.</p>

<p>Towards midday, as we were crawling
painfully up a perpendicular forest hung
out like a hearth-rug left to dry, over the
side of a three-thousand-foot cliff, I fancied
the light ahead was growing very clear.
All morning we had been working along
as one generally does in the interior, right
at the bottom of the forests, judging our
direction by compass and by the rise of the
land, and seeing no more of the country
in general than if we had been crawling
along in the depths of the sea. But the
light ahead and above looked as if there
were a big break-off somewhere. I pointed
it out to the Marquis, to encourage him.</p>

<p>“I believe that’s the southwestern face
of the Kiloki Range we’re coming to,”
I said. “If there’s a big drop there, and
if we can get down, it will give us a long
lift on our way to the Government station.”</p>

<p>The Marquis paused to wipe his dripping
face; it was atrociously hot in there, sheltered
from all cooling breezes. He cast
a glance at his khaki shirt and trousers,
crumpled and stained and torn in many
places.</p>

<p>“Has he a wife or a daughter, and is she
beautiful?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Who? The R. M.? Don’t know who
he is; but I should think it most unlikely
he has any womenkind up there.”</p>

<p>The Marquis sighed and was silent.</p>

<p>We were coming up to the light now, and
it grew clearer and clearer. There was
evidently a big drop somewhere very near.
And unless my ears were much mistaken,
there was also a big waterfall.</p>

<p>“Hear that, Marky,” I said, “that
roaring sound? You’ll probably see a
young Niagara somewhere when we get
to the top.”</p>

<p>Well, it was not a Niagara or a Victoria
Falls, but it could have held its own very
well with any other fall in the world you
might like to mention. When we came
out on the summit we saw that the whole
countryside was broken away under our
feet and that the nearest thing to us, as we
stood up there on the verge of a mighty
basalt wall, was the feathery top of a
forest so far beneath as to be half blue
with distance. And we saw that the
whole of this immense rampart, greater
than any straight-down drop I had ever
seen in my life, was taken at one leap by
a river that came down from a ridge above
the one we had been climbing.</p>

<p>The Marquis stood quite still on the
summit, looking at the indescribably magnificent
view spread out below, for some
minutes.</p>

<p>“To think,” he said, at last, “that it
is ours alone—that no other eye shall——”</p>

<p>“Get your revolver out,” I said. There
was no use making a fuss—I hate fusses—but
there was also no use trying to deny
that our unlucky fate had caught up with
us again, and that the puzzle of the morning
was fully explained at last. There, on the
verge of the precipice, standing nonchalantly
with their toes half over, as only a mountain
native can, were a dozen or more Koiroros
who had slipped out of the bush like snakes
as the Marquis was speaking. From what I
could see, they must have taken a short
cut, got to the precipice before us and been
comfortably waiting for our arrival.</p>

<p>This time there could be no doubt whatever
about their intention. They had
surrounded us before you could say “knife”—not
very close, but near enough to be
dangerous—and were creeping closer and
closer, poising their stone-headed clubs in
an ominous manner. From the dense wall
of greenery behind, a spear came whistling
out, excellently aimed for the Marquis;
it missed him by no more than an inch.
Another went into my hat and knocked
it off.</p>

<p>We drew our revolvers and fired. The
Marquis got his man clean through the
temple and dropped him as neatly as one
could wish. Mine was hit in the ribs;
he fell over the precipice, and his cry, as
he went down, grew thin like the whistle
of a train running away in the distance,
until we ceased to hear it. We had not
much leisure for listening, in any case.
The Koiroros had bolted at the first shot,
as natives usually do; but they were busy
throwing spears from cover now, and the
Marquis and I had to use more ammunition
than we liked, firing at random into the
green, before we succeeded in stopping
them.</p>

<p>They did seem to be driven off at last,
however, and we began walking along the
edge of the precipice, to try and find a
way down, for that was now a vital
necessity.</p>

<p>There was none.</p>

<p>We tramped and climbed and looked
for half the afternoon. The sun got down
in the west; we ate a little of our food as we
clambered about, seeking endlessly, and
drank from the pools made by the spray
of the waterfall. That waterfall! It
blocked us like a wall of iron; we could
not cross it, or swim it, or get down alongside
it. It was, in truth, an efficient gatekeeper
to the country of the Stone Ovens.</p>

<p>“Marky, I’m of opinion that they knew
this all along,” I said. “They played with
us like cats with a mouse. They let us go
just this far, knowing we could get no
farther. As to what I think of the
beasts——”</p>

<p>I said what I thought, without laying
any restraint on myself. The Marquis
listened for a moment, and then jumped
up—he had been sitting on a stone—and
gave a kind of howl.</p>

<p>“Look down!” he cried. I looked. Far,
very far below I saw the figure of one of the
Koiroros, carrying a dead body on his
shoulders, like an ant going home with a
grain of corn.</p>

<p>We were a good way from the waterfall
at that moment, but the wall was still
unbroken, and I could not see any place
where the man could have got down. Still
down he had evidently got, and the sight
encouraged us more than I could say.</p>

<p>“The sun’s failing us now, Marky,”
I said, “but tomorrow we’ll find that
track or die.”</p>

<p>“I think you have reason; if we do not
find it, we shall undoubtedly kick the
bucket in this out-of-the-road wilderness,”
replied the Marquis. “And if we were to
finish like that, how many women of a
great beauty and a great kindness would
pour tears for we two over all the world!”</p>

<p>The sun was going down.</p>

<p>“Your watch first tonight, Marky,”
I said. “And my turn for the diamond.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I had the stone around my neck next
morning when it came daylight. We were
both pretty tired, with short sleep, short
food and hard work, but neither of us was
anything like done, and I for one felt
almost brisk when the fresh wind of sunrise
sprang up, blowing the ferns and orchids
about on the edge of the precipice and
sending the spray of the great waterfall
flying out into the sun. The Marquis was
sleeping just then. I did not wake him,
but got up to reconnoitre; this sunrise
hour is the clearest of all the day, and one
can see the distant peaks and ranges that
are invisible once the eight o’clock clouds
begin.</p>

<p>I did not particularly like what I saw.
In all the wide expanse of close-furred
green before me there was not a break, not
a suggestion of a clearing or a station;
only the wave on wave of primeval sea of
tree-tops that buries all New Guinea beneath
its overwhelming flood. Far in front
the green lapped into a fold that suggested
a river; that was my only hope. As to
these mountain torrents....</p>

<p>Was that a cough?</p>

<p>It sounded like one—the cough that a
native gives when he wishes to attract
attention. I turned around to face the
wall of bush, but could see nothing, and I
could not even be sure I had heard anything,
for we were not far from the waterfall and
its thundering noise.</p>

<p>Well, if there had not been anything to
hear, there was certainly something to see—a
green bough waving frantically, all by
itself, as if shaken by an unseen hand.
The hand itself appeared by and by, and
now the bough was waved more violently
than ever, while a voice cried out in the
Mambare dialect, “Let us speak!”</p>

<p>“Speak!” I answered, waking the Marquis
with a push and telling him to keep ready
with his revolver.</p>

<p>“Is it peace?” continued the unseen native,
whom I guessed to be the Koiroro who
had interpreted before.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” I yelled.</p>

<p>“We want the sorcerer’s great charm,”
came the reply.</p>

<p>“Come out,” I said. “I will do no harm
to you.”</p>

<p>Out they came, two of them—the interpreter
and (as I had rather expected) the
big sorcerer man who had worn the crown
of paradise plumes. They motioned that
we should lay down our arms, while they
laid down their clubs and spears, and this
being done, the interpreter and the sorcerer
came forward.</p>

<p>“You have guns that bite badly in your
belts,” said the interpreter. “We thought
you had none, because there were no long
sticks such as the white men’s guns usually
have. But you have good guns; we shall
not fight you any more.”</p>

<p>“Very kind of you,” I said.</p>

<p>“All the same,” continued the interpreter,
“we will not let you go unless we like.
There is a way down, but you will never find
it if we do not tell you about it. If we do
not tell, you will stay here till you die,
and the wild pigs and dogs will come and
tear your tongues out and eat your throats.”</p>

<p>“What do you want?” I asked, guessing
the answer before it came.</p>

<p>“This sorcerer, who is a very great chief,
wants your charm. If you give it you can
go, and we will give you sweet potatoes to
take with you.”</p>

<p>“Get the sweet potatoes and we will
talk more,” I answered, being willing to
gain time. The men disappeared.</p>

<p>“What do you think of that, Marky?”
I said, translating.</p>

<p>“I think it is damn presumptuous cheek,”
replied that nobleman, trying to smooth
his hair with his pocket-handkerchief and
ruefully feeling his bristly beard. “What
a species of an object I shall be if we get
to that station!”</p>

<p>“Well, it does seem as if the diamond
landed us in a fix everywhere we go,” I
remarked. “What on the living earth
are we going to do?”</p>

<p>I took the stone out of its case and looked
at it. All in the rough as it was, it had
some splendid rays when you got it into
the sun. Just now it shot out crimson,
blue and green like a display of fireworks.</p>

<p>“Mark, it’s a beauty,” I said. “I don’t
see myself giving it up to a man-eating savage
to make spells with; not much. But
I don’t see either——”</p>

<p>“The Aryan races,” began the Marquis.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t get scientific,” I begged.
“I don’t feel as if I could stand it this
morning, somehow. Besides, I was discussing
what we were going to do.”</p>

<p>“Also I, if you would permit. The
Aryan races—or, if you will be impatient
and make grimace at me, I will jump some
thousand years. You say you can not
think what we shall do; it is solely because
you are of the Teutonic descent. It has
courage, this branch, but nimbleness in
the mind it has not. The Latin races of
whom I am one——”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it, Marky,” I begged. “I
believe they’re coming back; we’ve got to
be serious.”</p>

<p>“I am everything that there is of serious,
man with a head of a cabbage! I myself
will show you what it is to belong to the
Latin. Do you leave the negotiation to
me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can do the talking,” I said.
“You can do no harm, if you can’t do good.
I’ll pass on anything you say, and at the
same time keep a lookout for an ambush,
which is just as likely as not.”</p>

<p>The Koiroros, it appeared, had brought
the sweet potatoes with them, and concealed
them not far away, for there they
were, back again with a good load before
the Marquis and I had well finished our
discussion.</p>

<p>“Now,” said my companion, drawing
himself up to his full height, “it is for you
to see what it shall mean to be of the Latin
and not of the Teutonic race. Behold!
Tell them they shall not have the diamond.</p>

<p>“Tell them that I am a greater sorcerer
than this man is and that I know many
wonderful sorceries.</p>

<p>“Tell them I will sell this man a sorcery
that will make him king of his tribe, you
bet, if he will give us the secret of the path.</p>

<p>“Tell him to behold me and see!”</p>

<p>The two Koiroros, already much impressed
with the lordly tones and gestures of
the Marquis, watched narrowly as he took a
packet of cigarette papers out of his pocket,
looked solemnly towards the rising sun,
held up one paper to its rays and then bent
his head over it, muttering to himself....
I asked him afterwards what he had been
saying that sounded so impressive, and he
confessed that it was merely the French
for “Twice one is two, twice two is four,”
etc.</p>

 <p class="hanging caption">I cannot describe the extraordinary appearance he made there
on the mountain-top in the scarlet dawn, with the cannibals
looking on while he performed his incantations</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>When he had finished his muttering—the
Koiroros now drawing back a little
in obvious fear—he lit a match and burned
the paper, waving his hands over it as it
burned. I can not describe the extraordinary
appearance he made, there on the
mountain-top in the scarlet dawn, with the
naked, feathered cannibals looking on while
he performed his incantations—his dirty,
huge, bedraggled figure carrying a dignity
all its own.</p>

<p>At the end of these mummeries, he cast
the ashes of the paper to the winds, raised
a terrifying shout, and taking hold of his
(false) front teeth, pulled them down to the
level of the lower lip and let them go again
with a snap.</p>

<p>The two Koiroros turned tail and fled
into the bush, actually leaving their spears
and clubs behind them in their panic. A
long way off we could hear them howling
with fright. The Marquis and I had to
call for quite a long time to get them to
return. When they did come back, the
sorcerer seemed to have recovered his
nerve in some degree, but he still looked
uneasily towards the Marquis, whom he
now appeared to recognize as a superior
in his own line.</p>

<p>“Tell them,” said the Marquis, “to
show us the way and I will give them the
papers.”</p>

<p>“He says he wants one now, to do the
trick,” I reported.</p>

<p>Solemnly the Marquis pointed to the
rising sun.</p>

<p>“It is above the horizon—did he not see
that it was not yet cleared of the earth
when I enchanted?” he said. “Say that
he shall make the spell at tomorrow’s
sunrise, but never before again.”</p>

<p>The sorcerer, his eyes starting out of his
head, half walked, half crawled to the
Marquis’ feet and accepted the cigarette
papers, trembling. He stowed them away
in his charm bag and then made signs to
us to follow. We went after him along
the rim of the precipice to the very edge
of the waterfall, and <span class="lock">saw——</span></p>

<p>Well, after all!</p>

<p>Only a six-sided column of the black
basalt—the sort of thing you see in photographs
of the Irish Giant’s Causeway—that
lifted out of its place as neatly as a
finger out of a glove and left a hole through
which a man might squeeze himself. And
once squeezed through, a man came out—behind
the waterfall.</p>

<p>There it hung in front of us, as we passed,
like a gigantic crystal curtain, magnificent
beyond all telling. And in the hollow at
the back, where the water had worn the hard
basalt away, foot by foot through countless
æons of years, was the roughest of rough
staircases, cut by native hands and leading
down the cliff. Slippery wet with spray,
perilous to the last degree and scarce passable
for a white man’s foot, yet, after all,
it was not quite impassable, or so we
found. In an hour or less we were down
at the bottom of the wall; the secret of the
Stone Oven country was told.</p>

<p>More than that, the sorcerer had informed
us as we went down that the Government
station was a bare two days away, down
the valley of the river that we had dimly
discerned from the height. And we had
potatoes enough to last us all the way.
And the diamond was still ours.</p>

<p>“Heaven tempers the wind to the lame
dog; we are well out,” said the Marquis,
looking up at the top of the ridge as we
paused in the river bed below. The
sorcerer, far away against the skyline, was
faintly visible, feeling his jaw.</p>

<p>“I wager, on sunrise tomorrow morning,
there shall be some sore teeth in the chief-house!”
said the Marquis, with a chuckle.</p>

  <p class="in_dropcap">
    <span class="flt_lt_std">“</span>
    <span class="dropcap">N</span>
<span class="smcap">ame</span> of a name of a name of a
name of a dog!” said the Marquis
through his teeth. “What’s
this that we have arrived at?”</p>

<p>We stood in the bush at the edge of the
little clearing and looked across a small
space of muddy earth, planted with clothes-props,
into a wide, doorless open door. It was
night, and you could see little of the building
itself—only a long, low outline against the
stars and that big oblong of orange light.</p>

<p>Inside, about a score of men were sitting
on rough benches nailed to the wall. They
all had glasses or tin pannikins in their
hands, and they were drinking, slowly and
quietly and without any joviality or talk.
Their eyes were fixed in one direction; it
seemed that they were looking at something
beyond our range of view.</p>

<p>Inside the room some one was singing;
a rollicking, vulgar music-hall song with a
great deal of “beer” and “booze” in it
and not a little bad language, apparently
thrown in by the singer. Some of the song
was certainly funny, though with a coarse
kind of fun; and, all in all, it was not the
sort of thing that most men would have
listened to with faces like tombstones—especially
the rough-looking crowd that
was seated there on the benches round the
wall. But there was never a smile on a
face. They listened and they drank, grave,
unmoved and gloomy.</p>

<p>The Marquis used some more curious
expressions, apparently translated from the
French.</p>

<p>“This is evidently not the Government
station upon which we are fallen,” he said.
“Tell me, then, is it by chance some lunatic
asylum? Or has the impossible things
we have encountered in that Country of
the Stone Ovens made me myself insane?”</p>

<p>“I reckon we’ve hit on the Kilori goldfield,”
I said. “That comes of having no
compass and being chased all over the shop
without a chance to see where you are going.
We must be twenty miles further down
towards the coast than I thought, and a
good bit to the westward. It’s as good as
the Government station, Marky. There’s
a store here, and we’re in known country
now all the way.”</p>

<p>“We are arrived somewhere, if it is
store or station or asylum of lunatics—I
don’t care me,” said the Marquis. His
face was neither fat nor pink in these
strenuous days; it was yellow with starvation
and hardship, and there were lines
from his ears to his neck. His clothes were
a mass of rags and exceedingly dirty; his
boots nearly worn out. You would never
have known him for the spruce, smart
gentleman of France who had lounged
about the coral walks of Samarai only a
week or two ago. But in that week or two
we had been through adventures before
which all the troubles previously brought
upon us by the Sorcerer’s Stone seemed as
nothing at all. We had been shipwrecked
and marooned on a foodless, uninhabited
shore a hundred miles from anywhere,
along an inaccessible coast. We had wandered
starving, houseless and guideless,
about an unexplored tract of country only
fit for birds or monkeys to travel. We had
been captured by cannibals and nearly
eaten by them; had been imprisoned on the
edge of an apparently trackless gulf and
asked for the great diamond, no less, as
the price of the secret that would show us
the way down; had got away and struggled
through the trackless wilds below, racing
desperately to find the Government station
before we should succumb to hunger or
exposure—and at the last had found, apparently,
not the Government station, but the
Kilori goldfield.</p>

<p>I would rather have found the station,
in spite of the fact that the field was nearer
to the coast and had more supplies for us
to draw upon. In an ordinary way I would
sooner have trusted myself on a New
Guinea goldfield with a priceless diamond
on my person than in a civilized city. The
old hands among the miners of Papua are,
I suppose, about the most honest people in
the world. You can leave your “chamois”
of gold knocking about the store for a
week, if you choose to be so careless, and
know that not a grain of its contents will
be missing when you wake up to its existence
again. You can leave your claim in
charge of a mate, to be worked for you,
and go off to Australia for six months,
confident that when you return, every
weight that has been mined out of your
property will be fairly handed over to you.
The men who have stood the brunt of the
fearful hardships and taken the atrocious
risks that were and are the price of finding
gold in New Guinea, are not the kind to
play a fellow-miner dishonest tricks.</p>

<p>But the Kilori was another affair. It
was a field that had never produced very
much, until a rich find was made a few
months before our arrival. The find, of
course, attracted the usual “rush” from
Australia, a crowd made up of every mixed
element, as is the goldfields crowd all the
world over. In Papua, rich discoveries
are very soon worked out, as a rule, and the
riff-raff attracted by the gold, larrikins
and sharps, parasites and wasters of every
kind, sorts itself out from the men who are
of any use, and drifts back to the continent
of Australia, where there is more room for
its kind. But the process takes some time,
and I knew that the backward stream from
the Kilori field was hardly yet in flood.</p>

<p>It seemed to me, therefore, that we could
hardly have struck upon a worse place to
stay at. But stay we must, till we were
fed, clothed and sufficiently recruited in
strength to go on again.</p>

<p>I said something of this to the Marquis,
and he said that there was no use crying
over a bridge till you came to it, and, for
his part, what he wanted was “some many
tins of meat and a jeremiad of champagne.”</p>

<p>“Well, the sooner we get into the store,
the sooner you’re likely to be gratified,”
I said. I broke through the last of the
bush—there was no doubt a track somewhere
in the neighborhood, but in the growing
dark we had somehow or other missed
it—and led the way across the clearing.
Meantime, inside the store the ribald
song went on and the miners, seated round
with solemn faces, listened as if at church.</p>

<p>“I am intrigued to find out the meaning
of this, my Flint,” breathed the Marquis
down the back of my neck. “It is so
blessed queer.”</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. We were
inside the store in a few seconds, and there
before us there appeared what was surely
the oddest scene that even Papua, the
country of oddities, had produced for many
a year.</p>

<p>There was a table at the far end of the
room; on the table was a gramophone,
muffled up in black and surrounded with
white flowers from the bush.</p>

<p>All the miners were looking at the
instrument, and listening to it as they
slowly and seriously drank their whisky
and their beer. And the gramophone was
bellowing out the song that we had heard,
not in the voice of a trained singer, such
as one associates with mechanical records,
but in the raucous, howling tones of a man
who could sing very little and had handicapped
that little ability by getting drunk
before he began to sing.</p>

<p>It was a dead still night, here in the
clearing on the river flat, with the trees
shutting off every breath of wind all round
us, and the Kilori, inky-black and quiet,
running smooth as a canal behind the store.
The lantern in the rafters did not waver,
the white flowers thrown about the gramophone
lay still as flowers about the body
of some one dead. You could hear the men
suck in their drinks and swallow, in the
pauses of the song, and the grinding of the
wornout needle sounded sharply.</p>

<p>Many of the men I knew, though some
were strangers, and I was anxious to greet
my mates—doubly so, after all the troubles
that the Marquis and I had been through.
So I stepped right in, walked up to Hubbard,
who had shared a claim with me on the
Yodda years before, and held out my hand,
saying something in the way of a greeting.</p>

<p>It was received with an instantaneous
and universal “Hist!” Hubbard himself
said, “Wait—we must finish,” and pulled
me down on the bench beside him. The
Marquis, his innate courtesy rising above
his natural impatience and weariness, also
took a seat. The song went on to its
dreary end.</p>

<p>Then the storekeeper, an elderly man with
a wooden face, who looked as if he had seen
so many surprising things that nothing on
earth could by any possibility surprise
him again, took the black cloth off the
gramophone, removed the flowers and lifted
the instrument to put it away on a shelf.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” said one of the miners,
stretching out his glass of beer. “We’ll
give the poor beggar a last drink.” He
poured his beer into the gramophone, the
others looking on quite seriously.</p>

<p>“Are you all mad?” I inquired. “And
can’t you spare half a second to give a
drink to men who haven’t had any for
three weeks, when you’ve done feeding a
gramophone?”</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” asked the storekeeper.
I told him briefly.</p>

<p>We had no cause to complain after that;
old Burchell, the storekeeper, Hubbard,
and all the men I knew bestirred themselves
to find us food, drink, tobacco, clothing,
beds and to make us warmly welcome to
the Kilori. Our adventures didn’t astonish
any one very much; most of the men
had had experiences quite as startling in
their time. Yarns and reminiscences,
mostly colored with gore, ran like a flood
in the little slab-built bar of the storekeeper’s
house, and I saw the Marquis’ eyes
grow rounder and rounder as he listened.</p>

<p>I had really forgotten the gramophone
incident, being pretty well used to the
eccentricities of men who live for the most
part alone in the bush, when the Marquis
touched me with his elbow and asked me
to “demand the signifying of that astounded
event.”</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way,” I said, “what on
earth were you playing at when we came
up?”</p>

<p>Most of the men fell silent again. Hubbard
took up the word.</p>

<p>“Why,” he said, “we’d just buried poor
old Bobby-the-Clock, and when we came
back from planting him we thought we’d
hear him sing again for the last time—he
did love singing, poor old Bobby, though
he never could do it; and Burchell here
had a record he’d made one day when
Bobby was having an unusually good
time. So when we came back, we put it
on. And we gave poor old Bobby-the-Clock
a last drink, and we put him away
on the shelf. You needn’t look shocked,
you, whoever you are—” addressing the
Marquis.</p>

<p>The Marquis rose, bowed and introduced
himself. I said I never could remember
his name, so I won’t try to write it down.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Marquis,” went on Hubbard,
totally unmoved, “as I say, you needn’t
look shocked, for we did the whole thing as
reverent as if we’d been in church and
nobody could say we didn’t. Now he’s
planted, and we’ve done all we could for
him, and we’re going to forget about him
and cheer up; so here’s luck, Mr. Marquis.”</p>

<p>He finished his beer.</p>

<p>We got away as soon as we could from
Bobby-the-Clock’s memorial service, for
we were both suffering from the effects
of the “perish” we had been through,
and the Marquis declared he could not
exist another hour without a new set of
clothes. The store, rough as it was,
provided sufficient for our needs; we took
the plain shirts and trousers over to the
men’s sleeping-place, washed, dressed and
made ourselves decent again.</p>

<p>“Marky, you look like a miner now,” I
said.</p>

<p>“A cat may look like a king,” said the
Marquis, “but a king in gloves catches no
mice. I fear I should not make myself
much wealth, even in these uniforms of
the field, with the pick and plate of Mr.
Bobby-the-Clock. And, by the road, Flint,
what is the signifying of that singular
name?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that,” I said, laughing, as I struggled
into my own new clothes—“that was
only something Bobby did up on the
Yodda, years and years ago. He was
always a bit of a crank, and he got it into
his head that the storekeeper had cheated
him out of seven-and-sixpence over a bag
of rice—I don’t believe poor old Whitworth
ever thought of such a thing. But, anyhow,
Bobby believed he had; and it became
what I suppose you’d call an ‘obsession’
with him, to try and get it out of Whitworth
somehow or other. And one day, when he
was alone in the store, he nipped up a
seven-and-sixpenny little alarm clock—Bobby
wouldn’t have stolen to save his
life, but he reckoned that Whitworth owed
him that—and put it away in his clothes.
And just then a missionary turned up,
visiting the goldfields, and nothing would
do him—being Sunday—but he must hold
a service and pray for those terrible villains,
the miners of the Yodda. Well, they
started the service right away, in Whitworth’s
store, and poor old Bobby was let
in for it and couldn’t get out. And they
all heard the clock ticking, but they couldn’t
make out where it was, till right in the
middle of the missionary’s longest prayer,
off with a buzz and a rattle went the clock,
from somewhere about Bobby’s left trousers-leg.
The missionary reckoned they’d done
it on purpose, and he just shut up his book
with a bang and walked out, and Bobby,
who was terribly distressed, ran after him,
shouting, ‘Mr. Parson—Mr. Parson—I beg
your pardon! I beg your pardon!’ and all
the time the clock yelling away down his
leg. The miners were yelling too; some
of them were almost rolling on the floor.
We none of us meant to be rude to the
missionary, but it broke him up altogether;
he went right off that night, and we never
had the finish of the meeting. Bobby-the-Clock
kept the clock, and used it to waken
himself in the mornings; he was always a
sleepy beggar. And now he’s gone where
he won’t want clocks to waken him any
more.”</p>

<p>I fastened my last button and buckled
my belt. It was not supper-time yet,
and we had already fed, so we were not
impatient. We sat down on the canvas
beds that had been allotted to us and
looked about. The “dormitory” was a
rudely built shed, used for storing goods,
and open on one side; among the bags and
boxes were scattered bush-made stretchers,
covered with sacks. All around the little
clearing on the flat, the great, menacing,
unknown forest stretched its hands; it
made me think of people crowding and
shouldering round about an accident. And
to complete the parallel, the atmosphere
was so still and confined that one longed
to cry out, “Back—stand back and give
us air!”</p>

<p>The stars that had been above our heads
so many nights were before us now all down
the open side of the shed—the unforgettable
stars of Papua glowing like tiny moons in
the velvet-violet dark. I sat and looked
and smoked and thought the “long, long
thoughts” of the man who lives in lonely
places.... Many and many a year they
had been my roof, those holding, haunting
stars; they had me fast; they would not
let me go. They were more faithful to
me than wife or child could be; they had
been my friends when friends had failed;
they had told me things beyond the tongue
of men and angels. Tonight, they looked
down upon the grave of poor, harmless,
mind-bewildered Bobby-the-Clock; how
soon, I wondered, and where, would they
look down upon mine....</p>

<p>Diamond or no diamond, it came to me
then that the stars and the bush and cruel,
beautiful Papua, had got me for good. A
man may make a fortune ten times over;
but if he is not made of the clay that
sticks to gold when it touches it, he will
come back where he belongs in the end.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We slept that night as sound as Bobby-the-Clock
himself, in his forest bed a
dozen yards away. With the morning
came reaction from our excitement of
arriving; we were both dead tired and could
do nothing but saunter and lie about. It
was a hard week’s tramp to the coast, over
ugly country; I foresaw that we should
have to put in some days of resting before
we could face it. Carriers, too, would have
to be found somehow or other—if necessary,
borrowed from among the boys employed
by the various miners. The delay was
unpleasant to me, knowing what risks we
ran, but I did not see what else we could
do.</p>

<p>There were many more men about the
store today; a much rougher-looking lot
than the friends of the late Bobby-the-Clock.
A dozen or so of them—bad lots
from odd corners of the Commonwealth,
who had failed in finding payable gold,
seemed to be merely loafing about, living
on the storekeeper and waiting until the
long-suffering Government of Papua should
be driven into conveying them back to
Australia at its own cost. They and
another score or two who had found a
little gold, were drunk together as long and
as often as Burchell would let them; they
hung about other men’s camps after dark;
they had been accused of shooting natives
who were friendly to us and thereby laying
up trouble for the whole camp—they were,
in fine, a danger and a nuisance to the
field and every one of the decent, quiet
old hands would have been exceedingly
glad to see them cleared out.</p>

<p>Neither the Marquis nor myself liked
this company, so we kept away from the
neighborhood of the store and spent the
greater part of the morning bathing with
my old mate Hubbard in a safe, shallow
part of the Kiloki River. At least, the
place was safe if you didn’t go into it one
by one, and if you kept a good lookout for
alligators while you were in. That was as
much as we wanted. You would not
have thought that such a simple matter
as a bath in the Kiloki River could seriously
affect any one’s fortunes. But—as events
afterwards turned out—the Sorcerer’s Stone
was never put into quite so much danger as
it was by our lazy hour or two in the water
that morning.</p>

<p>What brought us out at last was an
incident not at all uncommon in the interior
of Papua, but none the less unpleasant—the
sudden plunging of a long blackwood
spear, liberally barbed, into the sand right
among us. We had none of us seen it
coming, but there it was, quivering with
the impetus of its flight, and showing
plainly, by the depth to which it had buried
itself, that it had been thrown with force
sufficient to drive it right through any one
it might have hit. And as the opposite
bank was not at all far away, and as none
of us had brought a gun, we thought it
best to clear out for the store as rapidly
as we could. There was a regular scramble
after our clothes, which had all fallen in a
heap; but we were dressed before you
could say “one, two, three, go!” and away
after our arms in about two seconds more.</p>

<p>Of course, nothing showed up when we
fired into the bush; but we sent a few bullets
smashing into the close-knit lianas and
orchids, just as an expression of opinion.
Hubbard wanted to go back and finish
our bath then, and I would not have cared;
the Marquis, however, told us we were
“ostentatious brigands,” and that, for his
faith, he had had enough. So we returned
to the store.</p>

<p>I don’t think I shall ever forget that
afternoon. It was one of the awful black
days that one experiences at times about
the steaming river flats of Papua; the sky
was a dark lead-pencil sort of color and
seemed to sit down on our heads like the
lid of a hot saucepan. The enormous
trees that had escaped the clearing and
stood about at its edges, lifted their endless
run of naked trunk and their weird, sky-pointing
branches up into the heights of
the sky with never a motion or a tremor.
Their leaves, far up beneath the iron lid of
the clouds, were as still as photographs.
Indeed, the whole clearing had the unnaturally
dead appearance that one notices
in a stereoscope; a thing that always seems
to me like the ghosts of dead scenes and
places.</p>

<p>As for the heat, it was just the next
thing to unendurable, and would have been
quite unendurable if one did not recollect
that scores of men had stood it, off and on,
for years. So that one reckoned, after all,
one could stand it too.</p>

<p>And it was on an afternoon such as this
that Burchell gave out his intention of
holding an auction of Bobby-the-Clock’s
effects, according to the custom of the field.
The money, of course, would be sent to
any surviving relatives Bobby might be
found to possess.</p>

<p>The Marquis wanted to go and see it,
and I went with him, though I was not
particularly anxious to do so. Burchell
had arranged to lend me three or four of
the carriers belonging to the store, and I
wanted to get my packs ready and prepare
for a start tomorrow or the next day, as
our condition might permit. I didn’t
fancy sleeping any longer than I could help
in an open shed with the riff-raff of Australia,
while the Sorcerer’s Stone was on my person—or,
worse, on the Marquis’. There were
several days of utter wilderness between
us and the coast, along the worst of tracks,
through pathless, unexplored forests, full
of natives who might at any time turn
hostile. That sort of thing provided far
too many ready-made occasions for accident,
in my opinion—should any one want
an accident to happen.</p>

<p>I have said that Papua is not a lawless
country on the whole, and it is not. But
there are things that affect the value of laws
and principles in their neighborhood, as a
mountain of ironstone affects the working
of the compasses on ships that pass beneath
it. A big diamond is one of these. In the
Sorcerer’s Stone we had, so to speak, a
charge of moral dynamite that was ready
at any moment to shatter friendship,
honesty, regard for human life, even regard
for a man’s own precious skin.... There
was not a bulwark built up through æons
of evolution, against the savage passions
of mankind, that this lump of crystal in our
possession could not send flying in a second.</p>

<p>Which meant, in brief, that if the rabble
at present polluting the Kilori goldfield
got the faintest inkling of the royal fortune
we carried, our lives, on that long track
through the lonely primeval forests down
to the solitary, unsettled coast might not
be worth the smallest of the chips that the
wheels of busy Amsterdam one day would
send flying from the surface of the stone.</p>

<p>I was thinking about this a good deal
while the auction went on. The proceedings
themselves did not interest me very
much, though I daresay the Marquis found
them amusing. Bobby-the-Clock’s old
clothes, his cooking-pots, his tin box, his
blankets, were put up and bid for; and most
of them brought very little. No gold had
been found in his camp; he had died of
fever, and was quite alone when he passed
out, so that the place had been left unguarded
for a day or more before any one
found him. There were those of us who
thought that some among the new-chums
might have told where Bobby’s gold had
gone; but nothing could be proved.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the auction, all in all,
would scarce produce the worth of a couple
of pounds to send to Bobby-the-Clock’s
relations.</p>

<p>Then the celebrated clock itself was put
up, and the bidding brightened at once.
Most of the old miners wanted it as a
souvenir, and some of the new ones seemed
determined to get it out of spite—for there
was much bad blood between the two
different parties. The bidding went up
and up, till at last the clock was knocked
down to my old mate, Hubbard, for no
less than two ounces—which, at the price
of the Kilori gold, was worth about seven
pounds eight.</p>

<p>“I’ll take it and pay for it now,” said
Hubbard, reaching out for his property.
He put it on the counter before him (we
were all sitting or standing about the bar,
with the doors and windows open for
air; the men who could not get places
loafing round the wall) and looked at it.</p>

<p>“Poor old Bobby! I’ve got the last bit
of him,” he said. “Two ounces, Burchell?
I’ve just about that on me, or a little more.
Weigh it for yourself.”</p>

<p>He thrust his hand into his trousers-pocket
and took out a packet.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” he said. “This isn’t
my gold.” He pulled the wrapper off and
flung down upon the table—the Sorcerer’s
Stone.</p>

<p>I felt my heart turn over and do a somersault
inside my chest. I don’t know what
I looked like, but nobody was noticing me,
so it did not matter. Everybody was looking
at the great crystal as it lay there on
the table, like a double-ended bit off a glass
chandelier. Hubbard stared at it uncomprehendingly
and said, “Where’s my gold
gone to?” with several strong expressions.</p>

<p>I put my hand in my pocket and felt a
small heavy parcel.... Of course!</p>

<p>It was all clear to me now. I had been
carrying the diamond in my trousers-pocket,
because it was the best place to hide it, in a
country where one wore so few clothes as
one did about the Kiloki. Hubbard and I
were wearing exactly the same pattern of
rough store clothes; we had got them mixed
when we dressed together in a hurry down
on the river bank, with the spear that the
natives had thrown at us sticking in the
sand at our elbows, to liven us up. And
there was the gem that the Marquis and I
had been concealing all these weeks, almost
at the cost of our lives, lying out on the
bar before the eyes of a crowd of sharps
and scamps from all the odd corners of
Australia!</p>

<p>One thinks quickly in moments of sudden
emergency; at least, if one doesn’t, one
won’t continue thinking or living long in a
country like Papua. I saw that there was
nothing for it but bluff to carry us through.
Giving the Marquis a kick under the table,
to warn him that the affair was best left
to me (he had taken the incident with
wonderful coolness), I stretched out my
hand carelessly and remarked:</p>

<p>“Why, that’s my crystal. Where did you
get it?”</p>

<p>I would have given all I possessed for
a quiet word with Hubbard, whom I knew
I could trust; but there was no chance of
that, so I had to do as best I could. The
thing was so enormous for a diamond and
so glass-like in appearance, here in the dim
light of the bar, that I thought it might
pass as a mere curio, if only I could keep
my nerve.</p>

<p>“I don’t know where I got it, but I do
know my gold isn’t in my pocket,” grumbled
Hubbard, feeling all over himself.</p>

<p>I handed over the little bag of dust.</p>

<p>“Here it is; I reckon you and I must
have got each other’s clothes when we were
bathing,” I said. Hubbard took the gold
and opened it.</p>

<p>“Weigh out two ounces; there’s near
three there,” he said. The storekeeper
took the bag and poured part of its contents
into the scales.</p>

<p>“That’s a fine crystal,” he said, looking
curiously at the great diamond as it lay on
the rough, hacked counter of the bar.
“Where did you get it?”</p>

<p>I did not altogether like the way in which
the bloated, evil faces of the new-chum
crowd turned towards me as I answered.</p>

<p>“Got it out of a sorcerer’s charm-bag in
Kata-Kata,” was what I said, reaching out
for the gem. “It’s rather pretty, and they
made a great puri-puri (charm) of it down
there. Some of the museums down South
will give quite a lot for good charms.”</p>

<p>A dirty, hairy man in torn moleskins let
out a sudden cackling laugh.</p>

<p>“Let’s have a look,” he said.</p>

<p>I handed it over at once, though my fingers
felt as though they were glued to the
stone. The day was so black and the bar
so ill-lighted that I did not think the
diamond, uncut as it was, would give out
any of those sudden rays that had first
attracted the attention of the Marquis and
myself. And if you did not catch it when
it was shooting green and violet and red,
there was really nothing to distinguish it
from a common bit of quartz—unless by
chance there happened to be a gem expert
among the crowd——one never knew.</p>

<p>I stole a cautious glance at the Marquis.
He looked perfectly unconcerned; he was
not even watching the diamond. He had
lit a cigarette and started smoking. His
face, a little pinker and a little plumper
today than yesterday, showed no emotion
beyond a slight shade of boredom with the
whole proceedings.</p>

<p>Meantime, the hairy man was handling
the diamond, weighing, turning and squinting
at it. He abandoned it in a minute or
two, at the request of another tough-looking
customer at the other end of the bar,
who called out, “Throw it over!” and the
hairy man threw. After that it was
chucked about from hand to hand like a
cricket ball among the men, most of whom
were half or more than half drunk by this
time—pausing occasionally in its wild flight,
as one or another kept it to take another
look.... I bit a piece of the inner side of
my lip right through, but I said nothing
and held out not so much as a finger to
check the stone’s career.</p>

<p>“Say! did this come from the Aikora by
any chance?” suddenly yelled a gray, dilapidated
creature with red eyes and ragged
beard, who was sitting on a case of
goods, being too far intoxicated to stand.
“There’s blue clay on the Ai—Aikora.”</p>

<p>“I tell you,” I said, wearily, “I got it in
Kata-Kata—black soil swamp country, if
you want to know. What’s that got to do
with it?”</p>

<p>The red-eyed man essayed to answer, but
a wave of intoxication mounted to his
brain and he replied in words that were
intelligible to himself alone. He would not
let go the stone, however. The rest of the
men seemed to have lost interest in it by
this time, and the dusk, which was now
darkening down in the stifling gloom of the
bar, seemed to promise me a chance of
slipping quietly away.</p>

<p>But the red-eyed man held on to the
stone. His words remained unintelligible;
he managed, however, to rise from his seat
and stagger round to the back of the bar,
helping himself to more liquor, and smashing
about with his hands among the glasses
for a considerable time. By the coolness
with which Burchell received these proceedings,
I judged the red-eyed man was
better able to pay for his fun than appearance
might suggest.</p>

<p>It was not long before the final stage
arrived. He staggered against the wall,
muttered and sank in a heap on the floor,
the Sorcerer’s Stone dropping from his
pulpy hand as he fell. The storekeeper,
with a bored expression of face, came forward
to carry him out into the air. I
volunteered to help and took care to slip
the stone in my pocket again as I lifted the
drunkard’s limply-hanging knees. We took
him onto the veranda and dropped him on
the earthen floor, his head on a sack.</p>

<p>“Drinking himself into the jumps, he
is,” observed the wooden-faced Burchell.
“Now tomorrow, like as not, he won’t
remember a mortal thing about this afternoon.
He’ll forget where he’s put his gold
some of these days; he’s drunk his mind
half away. Have a whisky with me?”</p>

<p>“Not after that,” I said, and walked away.</p>

<p>The Marquis escaped and followed me in
a minute or two. In the dusk of the goods
shed where the beds were, he fell upon my
neck—and it was no joke to have a man of
his size making a locket of himself about
your jugular vein—and cried:</p>

<p>“Splendid! magnificent! I felicitate you,
my friend! You have saved us both two.
You have the ingenious soul, the spiritual
mind—you are what they call a bully-boy!
Look, if that heap of misfortunates had
found out, we would have had a sudden
death hanging on the end of every minute
till we get back!”</p>

<p>“Not so bad as that, perhaps,” I said.
“Still, we’re well out of it. I wasn’t afraid
of the New Guinea lot; in the first place,
they mostly wouldn’t know a double-brilliant-cut
Cullinan if they found it in
their soup—they’re gold diggers and no
more—and in the second place, they
wouldn’t have turned dog on us—at least,
none of them that I know. But this
‘rush’ crowd gets me altogether; it’s the
worst lot we’ve ever had in New Guinea.
Do you think you could travel tomorrow?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know if I can, but assuredly I
will,” said the Marquis cheerfully. And
so it was settled.</p>

<p>The next morning my companion woke
me up very early, complaining of headache.
He was, as I have mentioned, extremely
temperate, and the small amount of bad
whisky he had taken for politeness’ sake
while looking on at the auction the day
before had been quite enough to upset him.
I told him that he had better go across to
the bar and get himself some soda water;
Burchell would not be up, but he could get
the keys and help himself. Then I turned
over for another sleep.</p>

<p>I had hardly dozed off when the Marquis
came back, looking strangely pale in the
yellow sunrise light.</p>

<p>“Flint, get up!” he said. “Come out to
me.”</p>

<p>He certainly looked unlike himself; I
wondered if he were going to be ill. Slipping
on some clothes, I followed him out
into the clearing, where the black oozy soil
sank down under our feet after the night’s
fierce rain and the pools were sending out
unwholesome steam in the growing warmth
of day.</p>

<p>“What’s to pay now?” I said.</p>

<p>The Marquis looked all round and then
replied in a cautious half-whisper:</p>

<p>“Flint, God of my Gods, he has engraved
all the glass!”</p>

<p>“Who has engraved what glass? Are
you crazy?” I asked. “Did you get that
soda water? This place is fairly soaking
in whisky; seems it’s you now.”</p>

<p>“You mistake yourself—I am not drunk.
It is that red-eye man I talk of. Last
night, when he walk about behind the
bar with that stone, he has cut all the glass
with it.”</p>

<p>“Burchell says he never remembers anything
next day,” I said, not seeing the full
force of what had happened.</p>

<p>“That may be, but when Burchell come
into the bar by a little, he shall see it, and
all the men who shall drink out of those
glass, they shall see, and, my word, the jig
is up!”</p>

<p>“You’re right, Marky, it will be,” I said
seriously. “Seems to me the best thing we
can do is to clear off right away.”</p>

<p>“No, that’s a cabbage-head thing to do,
my Flint. We are too near, if some of
them begins to think. No, it is for you,
or for me, to get very much drunk very
quick, and smash all that glass in one
blow!”</p>

<p>“Let’s go and have a look,” I said.</p>

<p>It was only too true. The whisky, like
Clara Vere de Vere, must have “put
strange memories in the head” of the red-eyed
man, whom I now suspected to have
had more experience with stones than the
rest. He had scratched and cut two or
three bottles, and a number of glasses in a
way that could not possibly have passed
unnoticed, and that could not, either, have
been mistaken for anything but the work
of a diamond. There are some things that
will scratch glass fairly well, but nothing
on earth that will cut into it clear and deep
and clean save the king of precious stones.</p>

<p>We stood there in the half light of the
ugly slab-built room, that was all stale
with dregs of drink and littered with rubbish,
straw and paper—looking at each
other.</p>

<p>“There isn’t much time to waste,” I
said. “Which of us is going to do it?”</p>

<p>“My friend, it is I who make this sacrifice,”
said the Marquis solemnly. “I
haven’t no doubt that you could get intoxicated
if I asked you in the name of friendship——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I think I could manage that
much,” I said. “Though I’m not a drinking
man, Marky, and never have been.”</p>

<p>“But I do not ask. Because, you see,
Flint, you are brave, but you are not artist.
Now me, I am both the two. I can act—name
of a little good man, but I can act!
You have seen me, in the dance—if I had
not been noble, I had been the most <a id="chg2"></a>celebrated
actor in Europe.”</p>

<p>“That’s right; I’ll allow you can act,” I
said.</p>

<p>“And see, if you were to do this thing,
you would not do it as an artist; you
would quite simply get drunk, and perhaps,
in the strong man’s rage, you should kill
some one, but you should not keep the
head cool to destroy this evidence here.
So I am drunk. In two <a id="chg3"></a>minutes, I sacrifice
my character. You shall see.”</p>

<p>I did see.</p>

<p>I do not think, while I still hold on to
life, I shall ever forget the scene that took
place in the bar of the Kilori goldfield,
there, in the early sunrise, with the Papuan
carriers coming in singing to their morning’s
work, and the giant Gaura pigeons, in
the bush outside, beginning to toll their
golden bells. It was a quiet spot enough
at six o’clock; at five minutes past it was
pandemonium. The Marquis went outside
to find a miner’s pick; came back with
it, looked about him, spat deliberately on
his hands, “to envulgarize himself,” as he
explained, seized the pick, uttered a madman’s
yell and went Berserk on the spot.</p>

<p>It was exactly like poking a stick into an
ants’ nest. You find a quiet little hill of
clay, with nothing stirring round about;
you smash into it with your boot-heel or a
bit of wattle, and instantly the earth is
covered in every direction with a scrambling,
scurrying—doubtless, if one could
hear them, a screaming—crowd, all bent on
knowing what has caused the disturbance.</p>

<p>That was what occurred at the Kilori
goldfield store on that peaceful, beautiful
southeast season morning, with the birds
singing and the river gently flowing just
outside and the sun coming up above the
trees to look down on another day. The
storekeeper jumped out of his bed and ran
into the bar, pajama-clad; the cooky-boys
scuttled in from the kitchen and peered
round the corner of the doorway, wonder-eyed;
the miners and the new-chums and
the hangers-on of the camp all came running
as fast as they could, some with
blankets still hanging round their necks, to
see what was going on. They were used to
rows in the neighborhood of the store, but
not to the sort of row that the Marquis
kicked up—doing it, as he afterwards
explained to me, “in artist.”</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>If I had not known the truth, I should
have thought him not only intoxicated but
mad. His gigantic figure, clad in pink and
green pajamas, seemed to fill the store; he
had at least a dozen arms and legs and
every one of them smashed everything it
touched. The canvas chairs were trampled
as though by an elephant. The rickety
bar, built up of whisky cases, went like a
match-box. He leaped the remnants and
swung his pick along the shelf where the
glasses stood. Not one of them survived.
He seized a bottle of whisky in each hand
and slung the two half across the clearing.</p>

<p>“Oh, my Lord! Oh, my Lord!” the
storekeeper kept saying. “Who’s to pay for
this?”</p>

<p>“Stop him!” yelled the miners, as they
saw the whisky begin to go. The Marquis
shot me a glance as he swung his pick
above a cask of beer, and I will swear there
was a wink in it. By this time all the
incriminating glass was gone.</p>

<p>The murder of a man, I think, would
have been looked upon more calmly than
the murder of a cask of beer, up here on
the Kilori goldfield, a long week from the
coast. But this last exploit was never
carried through. With one accord, the
miners flung themselves upon the handle
of the pick and dragged it down. They
dragged the Marquis down next by sheer
force of numbers and sat upon him. One
even counseled them to “sit upon his
head!” and flung his own body across the
Marquis’s fat cheek, as if he were a kicking
horse.</p>

<p>He did not resist. I caught another
lightning wink from underneath the surging
pile and I did my best to get the indignant
miners off.</p>

<p>“He’ll be all right now if you let him
alone,” I declared. “I’ve often known him
like this, and when it’s over, it’s over.
After all, he’s only done for a couple of
quarts of whisky and a few tumblers.”</p>

<p>“Where’s what he’s drunk, to make him
like this?” yelled the insulted storekeeper.
“He’s got to pay for all he took and all he
done. Marquis! A nice sort of marquis he
is, I don’t think!”</p>

<p>“He took a bottle to his room with him
last night,” I said hastily. “It doesn’t
take much to make him like this; he has
no head. You’ll be paid all right, Burchell;
he’s got any amount of money.”</p>

<p>“Let him up, boys,” ordered the storekeeper.
The diggers got off reluctantly
and left the Marquis on the floor, breathing
hard and looking wild.</p>

<p>“Come and lie down somewhere,” I
said. “We’ve got to make a start today
and you won’t be fit. Come on.” I led
him off, reeling and staggering realistically
and falling on my neck in a mimic drunken
frenzy of affection. He kept it up till
we reached the sleeping shed—empty now—and
then drew himself erect and became
more dignified and Marquisatorial than I
should have thought any man could be
in bare feet and pink pajamas, with his
hair all over his face.</p>

<p>“I have sacrificed myself,” he said.
“My character, she is gone. But procrastination
is the steed that is stolen;
I have act at once and we are saved.”</p>

<p>“You stop there and don’t get well too
quick, in case any one comes back,” I
said. “I’m off to get our packs ready and
the carriers under way. The sooner we
get out of this the better, Marky. I want
the society of a few nice restful cannibals
to quiet down my nerves.”</p>

    <span class="flt_lt_std">“</span>
    <span class="dropcap">I</span>
<span class="smcap">t’s</span> a wise child that knows ’tis folly
to be wise,” said the Marquis.</p>

<p>He was sitting in the supper-room,
enjoying trifle, floating-island, tipsy-cake
and the other items of a somewhat
sticky and gassy supper. His partner,
Mrs. Vandaleur, a very fascinating little
widow in a demure black dress and the
most scarlet of scarlet silk stockings, had
just been carried off by the fluffy and
indignant young Government officer to
whom she rightly owed the supper-dances.
The Marquis, who had danced without
intermission from the first striking-up of
the band (one piano, out of tune; one
violin, much affected by the climate and
given to emitting rat-like squeaks) until
the eighteenth item in the programme, was
now resting and refreshing; I, who had
given up dancing many years ago and
who wasn’t likely to begin again at a Port
Moresby “shivoo,” was watching—if the
truth must be told—watching the Marquis.</p>

<p>I was already getting uneasy about him,
though we had only returned to the comparative
civilization of Port Moresby the
week before. We had a good ten days to
wait for the next steamer to Sydney,
and Port Moresby has nearly three hundred
inhabitants, being a good deal the largest
settlement in Papua. What were the
chances of some one of the three hundred
finding out in the course of those ten days
that we possessed the second biggest diamond
in the world, if the Marquis went
on as he was doing now? It was his turn
to wear the stone, and nothing would
induce him to give it up to me for the
night, even though it was much harder
for him—being fat—to hide it about his
person than for me. There it was, perfectly
visible to me at all events, sticking
out like a small tumor under the front of
his shirt; and unless I was much more
stupid than I supposed myself to be, it
had already attracted some attention from
little Mrs. Vandaleur.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vandaleur—Daisy Vandaleur, as
most people called her (she signed herself
“Daisie,” in her numerous letters)—was
always referred to as “little”; she was, as
a matter of fact, about the average height
of womenkind. But she had a small head
and very small hands and feet and a way
of looking little and forlorn. And she was
fond of calling herself a “poor little widow.”
I needn’t go on describing “Daisie”—every
one who has reached the age of thirty
has met her and knows her by heart.
She had a puggy sort of little dog and a
catty sort of companion, and she was a
little pious and more than a little musical,
and knew how to put on her clothes (I
said as much to a lady at the dance, and
she replied that in that case it was a pity
Mrs. Vandaleur didn’t use her knowledge
more liberally; also, that she at all events
knew how to put on her hair. Which
gives you the attitude of feminine New
Guinea towards “Daisie,” in a word).</p>

<p>The little widow, of course, had set her
cap at the Marquis from the moment of
our return. That did not trouble me or
the Marquis either. (“Many dear women,
they have done so, and I love them for
it,” he explained to me. “I find it altogether
natural.”) Nor did it trouble me
much, from any ordinary point of view,
that she should have sprained her ankle—just
a trifle—when they were coming back
from a stroll on the grass outside the hall—because
Daisie was given to spraining her
ankle at appropriate times. But when the
Marquis lifted her up the steps of the
veranda and carried her to a long chair
to rest her foot for the next dance—why,
then I saw Mrs. Daisie’s little hand, as it
slipped down from the Marquis’ huge
shoulder, pause for a moment at the odd
lump under his shirt and feel it with the
dexterity of a pickpocket. The Marquis
did not notice; he was gazing into her eyes,
which were blue eyes and went prettily
with her Titian-red hair. I began to wonder,
however. And when the supper-dances
came and I saw Mrs. Vandaleur
walking in with the Marquis as lightly
as he walked himself, I concluded that it
was time to offer him a hint. Which I did.</p>

<p>He answered with the mangled proverb
I have already quoted, and filled himself
another glass of ginger ale with the roystering
air of a gallant in a Christmas Number
supplement. It really seemed to be going
to his head. I had had several whiskies
myself by this time; but my head is perhaps
of a different quality.</p>

<p>It was the southeast season at its worst;
in Port Moresby, that means that you live
in the midst of a roaring gale, day and night,
for months. Up here on the hill where
the dance-room was built, the veranda
trembled like the hurricane deck of an
Atlantic liner; the flags in the ball-room
tore at their moorings on the walls; down
the long tunnel of the supper-room the
wind went yelling like a lost soul on its
way to hell. The tablecloth flapped and
slatted; the crackers flew about. Mrs.
Daisie, dancing beyond the doorway with
the fluffy boy, clutched at her woeful
black skirts and twinkled the scarlet stockings
that so piquantly contradicted them.
I could see she was keeping an eye on me.
For some reason or other, Mrs. Daisie did
not like me—much.</p>

<p>“Look, Marky,” I said (the howling
of the southeaster isolated us from the
other guests, in our corner, as much as if
we had been in a room by ourselves),
“I want you to think for a moment what
it means, if people get on to the fact that
we have a diamond worth the whole island
of New Guinea in our possession. From
that moment, any peace we have—and
Lord knows we haven’t had much—ceases.
In a small place like this, one is safe enough
from robbery, but once on a liner, or in
Sydney, we’d want a corps of <a id="detectives"></a>detectives
to guard the stone—if we can’t keep it
dark. And of course, it <a id="chg5"></a>doesn’t matter
where or how the news gets out—it’ll
run over the world in a week, just the same.”</p>

<p>“All over the world!” said the Marquis,
thoughtfully. “You have reason. We
shall be famous, me and you. Flint, I
love to be famous. It is the glory of our
adventures that has already made that
little flower of the tropic, Dai-see Vandaleur,
love me as the poor little one loves. It
is true, she also thinks me beautiful. But
handsome is who tells no tales!”</p>

<p>“Will you let me keep the stone till the
steamer comes in?” I asked, dropping
the vexed subject. When a man of forty
odd begins to tell you about the women who
admire his beauty, you had better get off
that line of rails as quick as you can.</p>

<p>“On my conscience and my honor as a
peer of the ancient regiment of France, I
will—not,” said the Marquis. “I have
the heart of a child, as the little Dai-see
tells me, but a child I am not. Tomorrow
you will guard our property; the day after,
I, and so on to the end. To the end,
my friend.” He drank another bottle of
ginger ale in two gulps and waved his empty
tumbler in the air. “And even if the end
shall be Death, then, my friend, a dead man
is out of the wood. I love your English
axes.”</p>

<p>“Saws, I suppose you mean,” I said.</p>

<p>“I knew it had to do with tools; it is
altogether the same. Now I will show
this little beautiful some species of dancing
that will make her ready to die of love, there
on my feet.”</p>

<p>I really think the amount of ginger ale
he had drunk must have gone to his head
a little; or else it had so inflated him, mentally
and physically, that he was a trifle
above himself. At any rate, he volunteered
to give the company an exhibition of solo-dancing;
and the offer being promptly
accepted, started to do—of all things—Queen
Elizabeth dancing before the Scots’
ambassador, Melville.</p>

<p>“It is to please your English sentiment
and at the same time to warm the heart of
the little Daisee by laughter,” he explained
to me. “This is comic; a frolic idea.”</p>

<p>What a scene it was! The dancers, in
their odd mixture of day and evening
dress, gathered round the walls under the
slatting, tearing flags; the wild southeaster
yelling along the veranda, so that the music,
despairingly pitted against it, sounded
starved and thin; in the midst of the
cleared space, the Marquis, beneath a row
of guttering hurricane lamps, dancing Queen
Elizabeth.... He had a scarlet tablecloth
about his waist and a fan in his
hand; he had rouged his cheeks with a
scrap of red cracker paper dipped in water;
he had borrowed a pair of high-heeled
shoes (big man though he was, his foot
was amazingly small) and, in spite of his
bulk and his pink, fat face and his twinkling
trousers-legs showing below the drapery,
he was the ancient coquette of England
to the life. You could even see the sour
face of Melville looking on as the dancer
stepped and pirouetted “high and disposedly,”
watching eagerly for the ambassador’s
approval.... At the end he
laughed a high-pitched, cackling, old
woman’s laugh; struck the imaginary Melville
coquettishly on the shoulder with his
fan, dropped the tablecloth and became
instantly a dignified nobleman of the ancient
peerage of France.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vandaleur ran forward impulsively
as he finished and begged for more. The
room applauded. The Marquis danced
again.</p>

<p>“Let a Papuan with a drum be brought,”
he ordered. A boy was fetched from the
grass slope outside the hall, where a number
of natives had been looking on. He beat
his iguana-skin drum, as if for a native
dance, with the throbbing, intoxicating
beat of the New Guinea drummer. The
Marquis snatched a native feather crown
off the wall, where it had been hung as an
ornament, put it on his head and danced
“The Love Dance of the Sorcerer,” looking
at Mrs. Vandaleur all the time.</p>

<p>I must say he had used his Papuan experiences
well. The dance was New Guinea,
yet something more. It had sorcery in it,
mystery, magic and sinister, wicked charm.
You felt the sorcerer loved the lady and
meant to win her; but you were not quite
sure he did not mean to roast her on the
fire, and pick her pretty bones, by and
by.... The lookers-on applauded violently
and Mrs. Daisie, whether truthfully
or not, declared herself faint when he had
done, and had to be supported to a chair.</p>

<p>“Oh, you terrible man—you dangerous
sorcerer!” I heard her murmur as he gave
her his arm. “How many trusting little
women’s hearts have you charmed away?
Do you know the power you have? I
think you must be very cruel.”</p>

<p>“No, for I make my spelling gently;
‘fair and softly is always to be blest!’”
he answered, through the yelling of the
wind. Mrs. Daisie put up her hand
anxiously among her curls to see, I think,
if nothing was breaking away from its
moorings and, being assured of this, fainted
a little more in the corner to which the
Marquis had conducted her. Her head
grazed his shirt-front as she sank back in
her chair.</p>

<p>“Ah! you have hurt my little face!
Is it your heart that feels so hard and
sharp?” she asked. The Marquis, instead
of answering, lifted her onto her feet
again as lightly as if she had been a baby
and swung her back into the dancing-room,
where now the music was beginning again.</p>

<p>“What happened to the wife of Bluebeard,
little wicked?” he said as they
dropped into the <a id="chg4"></a>waltz.</p>

<p>I do not know that I have the best temper
in the world. Some of my friends say I
have the worst when you rouse it; but that
is an exaggeration. Anyhow, I could not
stay in the ball-room and see our fortune
swinging over a gulf of disaster on the
frail thread of the Marquis’ amorous
folly any longer. I went out to smoke and
to swear.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The next day it was my turn to wear the
Sorcerer’s Stone, and I was ready enough
to claim it. We had cased it in a piece of
silk and sewn that up again in a piece of
chamois leather, safely attached to a strong
cord. No one wears waistcoats in Port
Moresby, but I took care to select a shirt
some sizes too wide for me when I wore
the stone, and with a coat on, the loose
folds concealed it effectively.</p>

<p>I was feeling a little easier about the
Marquis, since I had succeeded in extracting
from him a solemn promise that he
would not, on any account or for any
reason, betray to any person the secret of
the diamond. At the same time, I managed
to persuade him into altering his clothing
a little, so that the stone could not be
noticed unless any one went actually feeling
about after it. More than this I could
not do.</p>

<p>There is very little in the capital of Papua
to occupy the mind of any reasonable
person. When you have been out to see
the native village, gone for a walk to Koki,
where the native servants employed in the
town hold nightly dances, and taken a
boat across to one or two of the islands,
you have about exhausted the interests of
the place. It is barren and rather ugly;
the white people are more civilized, and
therefore less interesting, than those of
Samarai; the natives speak English, wear
trade clothing and cheat the tourist over
curios. To any one recently returned, like
the Marquis and myself, from the mysteries,
horrors and adventures of the unknown
interior, nothing could be more flat and
tiresome than the silly little capital town.</p>

<p>All the more was I uncomfortable over
my companion’s evident fascination by
Mrs. Vandaleur, whom I frankly took for
an adventuress. Her very name was
against her; it savored too much of stage
posters to be natural. She was clever
enough, I could see, to keep free of scandals;
the dead or missing Vandaleur had not
divorced her; cards were religiously left
at her door by the ladies of the capital, who
seemed to find a weird delight in playing
at a strange imitation of the strange game
called Society, here away in the wilderness
of New Guinea. (“Like your Israelites
of the Bible,” said the Marquis, who
always spoke of the Old Testament as if it
were the exclusive property of the English
race—“these dear ladies make brick in the
desert without no straw; it is for that
reason, I observe, that their bricks do not
hold together the one with the other.” And,
indeed, the inhabitants of Port Moresby
love each other scarcely better than do
those of Samarai.)</p>

<p>But, though “Daisie” Vandaleur was
quite respectable, according to the canons
of the card-tray, and though, in any case,
there was no risk of the Marquis’ historic
coronet descending upon her well-dressed
head, I thought her none the less dangerous;
perhaps rather the more.</p>

<p>“That dear little one, she desires quite
simply to marry herself with me. I find
that very touching, though I can not accord
her her desire,” he said, sentimentally.
“Flint, I can’t tell you how much pity I have
for all those beautiful women who so desire
to marry with me. Of course, the day
shall come at last when one of those lovely
ones shall—what do you call it?—yank me
in. But the rest—my heart is bleeding for
those!”</p>

<p>He took out his embroidered silk handkerchief
and looked lovingly at the coronet.
I knew he was minded to tell me the history
of the lady who had worked it for him, so
I got away before he had made a start.
That was where I made my mistake. He
went right off to Mrs. Vandaleur’s and told
her.</p>

<p>They invited him to join the tennis club
after this. I never had time or inclination
myself to learn how to throw balls at a
man who doesn’t want them, and work
hard trying to get them back when I don’t
want them myself—so I didn’t see very
much of the Marquis at this period, although
for want of room we were sharing our
quarters at the hotel. After all, I had not
been brought up at the Court of France;
I did not know half the kings of Europe
and I did not possess even a shanty in
New Guinea, let alone a castle on the
Loire. These things had not seemed to
matter when we were away in the wilds
together getting chased by cannibals or
being shipwrecked or having snakes set
on us by sorcerers—going ragged and
hungry sometimes and at all times not
being quite as sure as we could have wished
that we were ever going to get safely back
again. But here, in the little tin-pot
capital, the kings and castles and things
began to crop up again. And—as they
say in sentimental novels—the Marquis
and I drifted apart.</p>

<p>The days passed very slowly, before the
steamer’s call. In the afternoons, when
the southeaster was howling harder than
ever and almost laying flat the little
eucalyptus trees that stand up all over the
many hills on which Port Moresby stands,
I used to climb the heights above the town
and wander idly about, holding on my hat
and thinking what I’d do with my share of
the price of the diamond—if we ever got
it safe away to civilization. And down
below on the flat, the Marquis would be
playing tennis with Mrs. Vandaleur or
squiring her about on the beach.</p>

<p>I never felt inclined to watch him on the
days when it was my turn to guard the
Sorcerer’s Stone. But on his days I don’t
mind admitting that I shadowed him like a
detective. In a town that is all small hills,
with every house overlooking all the others,
there is not much difficulty about that.
And I grew more and more uneasy, as the
time went on, to see the increasing number
of hours he spent with “Daisie.” Every
second evening, when he handed over the
chamois leather case, in the privacy of our
own room and said, “All right, my Flint!”
I felt as though another barrier between our
fortune and its realization had been painfully
passed over; another cast of the dice
fallen in our favor. For I knew now that
Mrs. Vandaleur had her suspicions; and
I trusted her—well, not half so far as I
could have thrown her supple, eel-like little
body.</p>

<p>Sometimes, from my eyrie among the
rocks above I saw amusing scenes on the
tennis ground and the flat. The most
amusing was on the day when “Daisie”
persuaded the Marquis to dance on the
tennis court with a cassowary, a pet of
some one of the residents, which used to
hang about the grounds, begging humbly
for cake, and if refused, instantly turned
vicious and jumped up into the air to kick
with both feet at the person who had
repulsed it. The players used to tease the
creature a good deal in order to see it fly
into a rage; it was a young bird and not
half grown, but it was very active and
went into the most amusing frenzies of
stamping, whistling rage. Cassowaries,
as most people know, are extremely fond
of dancing; and Mrs. Vandaleur incited
the Marquis, first to dance with the bird,
and afterwards to give an imitation of its
style. I do not think I ever saw anything
funnier than the tall, thin bird and the tall,
fat Marquis, setting to partners on the
green grass court, the cassowary taking its
part quite seriously, and sidling, chasséeing,
springing, like a girl in a theater; the man
craning his neck in imitation, stepping
stiff-legged, as it stepped and using his
arms exactly as it used its wings. Afterwards,
the Marquis improvised a “Dance
of the Cassowary,” and it was one of the
very best things I had ever seen him do.
I have heard since then that it has met with
much approval in his castle on the
Loire.</p>

<p>It was my day for the Sorcerer’s Stone,
so I looked on with an easy mind. After
all, it seemed to me, I had been making too
much fuss. The Marquis was not a fool,
and even if the little widow succeeded in
worming out of him the secret of the
diamond, it was only what would probably
happen sooner or later, somewhere. We
had been through so many risks with the
Sorcerer’s Stone that I had nearly come to
believe there was something supernatural
about it, for it always seemed to work out
right in the end.</p>

<p>Next day I was suffering from a touch
of fever, as most New Guinea residents
do at times, and I did not go out at all,
but stayed in my room and took quinine
till the walls spun round me. The attack
passed off towards evening, and I was
lying on my bed, feeling weak but better,
when the Marquis came in.</p>

<p>“Had a pleasant day?” I asked. He did
not answer, but went over to the washstand
and began washing his hands, with his
back to me. I was feeling almost too tired
to talk, so I lay silent for a while, watching
the eastern sky-line, through our little
square window, turn pink with the reflected
glow of the sunset in the unseen west, and
the green-gray eucalyptus trees streaming
before the ceaseless thrash of the “trade”
that blew up strong and stronger as the
night came on....</p>

<p>It occurred to me that the Marquis was
a very long time washing his hands. The
room was getting darker; the people of
the hotel were clashing plates and clinking
glasses down below. It was nearly dinner
time.... What could be the matter with
my companion?</p>

<p>“Say, Mark!” I called out from my bed,
“have you been murdering any one, like
Lady Macbeth, and are you trying to
wash the ‘damned spot’ away, or what?”</p>

<p>The Marquis turned round so suddenly
that he flung the tin basin rattling on the
floor, and the water rushed in a deluge
across the room. He did not take the
slightest notice of it. He came up to the
bed, and even in the twilight I could see
that his face was white.</p>

<p>I knew what had happened before he
spoke.</p>

<p>“Flint,” he said, beating his pink, soapy
hands up and down in the air, “I can not
tell you. I can not tell you. My God,
what have I done!”</p>

<p>He sat down on the floor (we had no
chair) right in the middle of the deluge
of water and began to cry.</p>

<p>“I have betrayed and ruined you, my
friend,” he said. “I would like to die,
here where I am; what is the use that I
should live? I say that I can not tell you
what I have done.” He wept again.</p>

<p>“Oh, get out of that water and sit on the
bed,” I said. “You don’t need to tell me;
all I want to know is, how it happened and
what Mrs. Vandaleur has to do with it.”
I was feeling pretty bad about the affair—for
I saw in a moment that he had lost the
diamond—but there is never any use, to
my mind, in making a fuss.</p>

<p>The Marquis jumped up and tore open
his shirt with the air of a man who was
opening his very heart for your inspection.
Round his neck was hanging a string and
on the string was a small silk bag—empty.</p>

<p>“Not one confoundable thing has that
angel had to do with it,” he said. “It is
altogether me. I took it out of the chamois
case this morning, because when I play
tennis that chamois sticks and comes to
go out of the front of my shirt. But the
silk, it slips and does not come out. So I
take away the chamois and I play tennis
all the afternoon. And in the end, when
it is time to go and they have all gone, all
but Mrs. Daisee and me, I feel my hand
into my shirt and there is nothing there!
I tear out the bag and it is splitted——”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know that no silk will stand
in the tropics? It was only a protection
for the stone. You might as well trust
tissue-paper as silk, in New Guinea,” I
said wearily.</p>

<p>“I did not know, I swear. Well, when
I see it is gone, I tell Daisee that I have lost
a something I have the greatest value for,
a gem—I do not say a diamond. And
she call many native boys. And they look,
look, look, till it get dark. And I will
swear, if it were that I was dying, we look
every inch. But there is no stone.”</p>

<p>“I reckon Mrs. Daisie could tell you——”
I began.</p>

<p>“Halt!” cried the Marquis. “Daisee
is as innocent as the lamb unborn. When
we see the stone is lost, she will not look
herself. She sit on the seat and watch.
She weep for me, that little one, she is
most blooming sorry. But she will not be
suspect; she won’t touch that searching
herself. She can not understand and I
can not understand. It was all razed clean,
that ground; there was no gulfs anywhere,
and the weeds was not. I should have been
finding all right. But, my God, it is
not!”</p>

<p>He seemed so exceedingly distressed that
I could not find it in my heart to say what
I thought of him and his carelessness, and
of Mrs. Vandaleur—whom I could not
believe altogether innocent—and of the
whole wretched affair altogether. After
all, Marquis or no Marquis, the man was my
“mate,” and we had been through a lot
together, and a nicer fighter than he was
when one got into a tight place, I never
wished to find. And neither he nor I was
worse off than either had been a month or
two ago; we had lost nothing—except a
dream. It was a splendid dream, no doubt,
and one that I at least was never likely to
have a chance of dreaming again. But I
thought I could do without it, on the whole;
and if I could, who hadn’t done the mischief,
so, I reckoned, could he.</p>

<p>I said something to this effect, and the
Marquis wiped away his tears. It was
with a red silk handkerchief this time, and
the embroidery of the coronet, as he told
me, had a story attached to it that was
written in his heart’s blood.</p>

<p>“Has Mrs. Daisie given you a handkerchief
yet?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No,” he said quite gravely, “she has
but given me a hymn book.”</p>

<p>“A hymn book!” I yelled, choking with
laughter. “What in the name of everything
inappropriate should Mrs. Vandaleur
give you hymn books for?”</p>

<p>“She is very devoted,” said the Marquis
reprovingly. “She thinks that she will
make a Lutheran of me. Of course, there
isn’t any dashed chance that such a consummation
could arrive, but it makes the
little one happy. Me also. As for the
hymns, she sings them to me; I hear her
sing them when I come up the road past
her little bird-nest of a house.”</p>

<p>“What does she sing?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Something that is in the hymn book,
and that the great Clara Tun—no, Butt—Clara
Butt sings also; it is altogether
touching. ‘Abide with me.’”</p>

<p>“Does she?” said I, sitting up. “I call
it irreligious and bad manners both, if she
does. Every man to his taste. Are you
going to ask her to help us to look for the
diamond tomorrow?”</p>

<p>“I won’t do nothing you don’t wish,”
said the Marquis, with sudden meekness.
“I can not forget that I have ruined you.”</p>

<p>“No fear,” I told him. “Are you going
down to dinner, or aren’t you? Tell them
to send me up a bit; I’m getting better.
I rather think you and I are going to have
a busy day tomorrow, Marky.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We had. I got up a bit before daylight
and had a dozen natives helping me
to search the tennis ground before the sun
was well up. We hunted for a good hour
and I came to the conclusion that if the
diamond had ever been on the tennis court
it certainly was not there now. I came
back and reported the result of my labors
to the Marquis. He was sitting in our
room and looked very gorgeous in a marvelous
pink silk kimono embroidered with
green and gold dragons; but his hair had
not been brushed up into its usual fierce
bristles; his mustache was as limp as a
walrus’ and his general aspect suggested a
pink cockatoo that has been out in the rain.</p>

<p>“Don’t lose heart,” I told him. “The
stone is somewhere. It’s been picked up,
you take my word for it. It must be in
Port Moresby, and you can leave me to
find out where.”</p>

<p>It was in my mind, and I could not get
it out, that if I wanted to know where the
Sorcerer’s Stone had gone to, I had better
keep as much in Mrs. Vandaleur’s company
as possible. So, without giving vent
to any suspicions I had or guessed at, I
allowed the Marquis to think that I had
got the better of my prejudices against the
little widow. I even accompanied him to
tea with her when he went there to call a
day or two after the loss of the stone.</p>

<p>It did not strike me that “Daisie” was
overjoyed to see me, but she greeted me
prettily and made tea for both of us. I
don’t know whether it was by accident or
design that she made mine cold and weak
and left out the sugar; if so, she did a foolish
thing, for it set me wondering just why
the little lady disliked me as much as she
did. In spite of the Marquis’ accusation,
I am not, and never have been, unhappy
in women’s society; nor have I had occasion
to observe that they are unhappy in
mine—to take a leaf out of my companion’s
books.</p>

<p>But Daisie didn’t want me, didn’t like
me, was more or less afraid of me.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>I watched her, sitting on the sheltered
veranda, with the southeaster roaring ceaselessly
outside, slamming at the blinds and
lifting the long mats nailed on the floor.
It was a wild day; a day to make any one
restless. Most Port Moresby folk find the
southeast season trying to the nerves, by
reason of the unending uproar of the persistent
“trade,” and I judged that the
wind—or something—was affecting Mrs.
Vandaleur’s nerves. She dropped a cup.
She snapped at the boy who was bringing
the tray. She started when one spoke to
her suddenly—as I confess I did. Her
color did not pale, but there may have
been reasons for that. She looked pretty
enough, with her floating black draperies
and her wicked little scarlet shoes, and her
daintily-dressed red-brown hair, to have
turned almost any man’s head, and I was
not surprised to see the Marquis more
devoted than ever. But as for me, I mistrusted
her from the crown of her expensive
curls to the sole of her little red shoe.
I drank my ill-tasting tea in silence, listened
to the roar of the wind and watched
the lady and her lover. And I thought.</p>

<p>She could not have picked up the stone
on the court—by what the Marquis said,
it was clear she had not known of the loss
until he told her. It seemed that she had
questioned him shrewdly then concerning
what it was that he had lost, and had
managed to extract from him a pretty
accurate description of the gem. He had
not actually said it was a diamond, but—from
what he told me—he must have
allowed her to guess what it was.</p>

<p>She knew, then, that he had had a diamond
of remarkable size; that he had lost
it in a small, easily-searched area. She
had not picked it up, and she had been
careful—too careful, I thought—to avoid
all possible suspicion of having done so.</p>

<p>Did she know where it was?</p>

<p>These were the thoughts that ran through
my mind while the Marquis flirted with the
lady, leaving me to talk to the uninteresting
elderly companion in the background.</p>

<p>I think he began to feel sorry, before
very long, that he had asked me to accompany
him to Daisie’s; for the little lady
seemed in a fascinating mood, and looked
as though she would not have been sorry
to have the drawing-room and the piano
left to herself and her friend. Doubtless,
even the Marquis’ self-possession shrank
from picking out sentimental-sounding bits
of hymns and reading or singing them in
her company before a couple of more or
less unsympathetic observers. Mrs. Daisie
gave me a look or two that were certainly
meant to be taken as hints, but I was
astonishingly stupid that afternoon and
could not understand her. Even when the
Marquis proposed going out to the little
back garden to look at Mrs. Vandaleur’s
plants, I was so stupid that I couldn’t see
they did not want me, and I got up to go
too, protesting that there was nothing in
the world interested me so much as the
selection and care of roses in the tropics.</p>

<p>“I never knew you were an amateur of
the garden,” observed the Marquis somewhat
ruefully. “You are then interested
in culture? Don’t put out yourself to
please us, my friend, if you would rather
love to stay in the house.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t put me out worth twopence,”
I assured him. We went out through the
sun and the wind, to the back of the
house, a rather gloomy party of four, all
trying more or less to be cheerful. I fancy
I succeeded the best. Mrs. Daisie made
great play with the care of her black draperies
in the storm, yet found time to
glance at me, I thought, unpleasantly, and
the Marquis was pulling his mustache.
But I was determinedly stupid.</p>

<p>The two got away in a corner of the
garden before long, shamelessly deserting
myself and the companion, and I could see
that Mrs. Daisie was talking religion again;
a thing that disgusted me, and inclined me
to have no mercy on her, if ever she should
need it at my hands. I can’t say I am
particularly religious myself, but any decent
man hates to see piety used as a cloak.
They had got out the hymn book she had
given him—a tiny, fancy little white leather
thing, the size of a match-box—and were
looking up something or other in it, their
heads very close together....</p>

<p>“Would you like to see the cassowary?”
asked the companion suddenly. I had
almost forgotten her existence; she was
of those gray, dusty women of no particular
age, whom, somehow or other, one
always does overlook.</p>

<p>“What cassowary?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Ours. It’s such a funny thing. It
dances and fights and does lots of queer
tricks of its own. We have it shut up in
the fowl-house.”</p>

<p>“What for?” I asked, yawning. The
companion certainly did bore me.</p>

<p>“Because Mrs. Vandaleur says it’s sick.
She bought it the other day; the people
who owned it wanted quite a lot for
it.”</p>

<p>The companion was opening the door of
the fowl-house as she spoke. Mrs. Vandaleur,
hearing the creak of the lock, turned
around, and if I did not mistake, her look
was very black. It cleared at once, and a
sunny smile overspread her face.</p>

<p>“So you are looking at my new pet,”
she said. “Poor thing, I think it is sick;
but it is very amusing when it is well.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this is my partner of the dance!”
said the Marquis, as the great bird came
solemnly out, turning its big brown eyes
suspiciously about and about. He held
out his hand to it, bowed, and began to
dance towards it, flapping his coat-tails in
imitation of wings, and singing, to an
absurd tune, the well-known nonsense
rhyme:</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->


<p>“Beautiful missionary!” he said, pausing
in his dance, “do you think the savage
animal would eat you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Mrs. Vandaleur
pettishly. “I can’t stand this wind; it
makes Daisie’s little foots too cold. Let’s
go in.”</p>

<p>“If it will not eat the lovely missionary,
will it eat the lovely hymn book too?”
asked the Marquis, teasing the bird with
the little book he held in his hand. The
answer came suddenly, and in a way that
he hardly expected. I do not think the
Marquis had ever heard that the cassowaries
are much the same as ostriches in
their appetite for strange and seemingly
inappropriate food. If he had not, he was
enlightened now. The bird stretched out
its neck with the darting pounce of a
snake, snatched at the gaudy little book,
gulped, swallowed and....</p>

<p>“By gum!” cried the Marquis, “she has
eat up the hymn book too!”</p>

<p>“Daisie’s little foots are so cold,” complained
Mrs. Vandaleur, shivering in the
wind. “Daisie wants to go to her little
own home again.”</p>

<p>It seemed to me that she was anxious to
pass over the incident without remark,
which struck me as odd, considering that
it was her own gift to the Marquis that the
mischievous bird had destroyed. We all
went back to the house, and before very
long our hostess began to yawn in an
elegant but obvious manner that conveyed
an unmistakable hint. The Marquis rose
to leave and I followed him.</p>

<p>He was looking worried and depressed,
and I should have been glad enough to say
something to comfort him a little if I had
thought it safe. But in the light of past
events, I certainly did not. Nevertheless,
I was mentally skipping and dancing all
the way back to the hotel. For now I
thought I saw my way.</p>

<p>When I had left the Marquis in his
room, I waited for a little while and then
went straight back to Mrs. Vandaleur’s.
I found her alone on the veranda; and this
time all her rouge could not conceal the
sudden paleness that crept like a white
mist over her pretty face when she saw me
return alone.</p>

<p>“I am flattered,” she said. “To what
do I owe the honor of this—very late—call?”</p>

<p>I looked her straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>“What will you take for your cassowary,”
I said, “your cassowary that is
sick (though it doesn’t look it) and that
will probably die in a day or two, suddenly?”</p>

<p>I always said the woman was an adventuress.
She never turned a hair or hesitated
a moment.</p>

<p>“A thousand pounds,” she said.</p>

<p>“You mean fifty,” I told her.</p>

<p>“A thousand,” she said, opening her
eyes very wide and trying to stare me
down. The wind was working up for
night; we had to shout at each other in
order to be heard.</p>

<p>“Fifty,” I said again. “It isn’t worth
a thousand to you to be driven out of the
country by that story.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is,” said she insolently.</p>

<p>“You forget,” I told her, “that this is
going to be a world-famous stone. You
can’t go to—Tahiti—or Nounea—or anywhere,
and cut loose from a tale that links
you up to a thing like the Kohinoor.
You’ll go with that story chained to you
like the ball on a convict’s leg and a thousand
pounds in your pocket—or we’ll keep
our own counsel, and you’ll keep yours and
fifty pounds.”</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence in the
veranda—silence but for the tearing of the
wind. The reed curtain in the doorway
slashed back and forth. The canvas awning
rattled like a sail.</p>

<p>“Give me the money,” said Mrs. Vandaleur,
without the slightest change of
countenance. But I could see that the
gauzy, sable laces on the bosom of her
dress were heaving like black seaweeds in a
storm.</p>

<p>I had brought a check-book and a fountain
pen. I wrote a check and gave it to
her.</p>

<p>“You might tell me how it happened,” I
said as I handed the paper.</p>

<p>“You know,” she said. “He told me
what he had lost. I’d seen the cassowary
in the corner of the ground, gulping down
something a moment before. They always
go for anything bright. So I guessed.
And when he told me, I brought the bird
over to the seat, while he was searching for
the stone, and I saw the thing going down
its neck inch by inch—as you can see if
you watch them swallow anything. Oh, I
didn’t take any chances. You’ve spoiled—you’ve
spoiled—the best——Did you ever
think what it is to be a woman and not so
young as you were, and with no prospects—none?
You never thought, or felt, or
cared, about any woman in the world—and
yet——”</p>

<p>Her eyes were very, very blue, and they
were very soft to see through the tears
that were gathering in them.</p>

<p>She looked at me and then looked away.</p>

<p>“And yet——”</p>

<p>I am never likely to know what she
meant by that. Nor do I very much care.
For there is a girl down in Sydney.</p>

<p>I never saw Mrs. Vandaleur again.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Marquis slept better that night than
he had done for some nights past. I had
a job to do before we slept; I did it—any
man who has been on sheep and cattle
stations understands that sort of thing
completely. I tidied up before I came into
the Marquis’ room with the recovered
stone; but there was a stain that I had
overlooked on one shirt sleeve. The Marquis
saw it.</p>

<p>“It began in dying and blood and it
ends in dying and blood,” he said. “Flint,
in one week we shall be in Melbourne and
we shall find a syndicate of Jews, and they
will buy our stone for very many thousand
pounds, and by gum! my friend, I shall
think we are blooming well rid of this so
remarkable treasure trophy of the wilderness!”</p>

<p>“I’m with you there,” I said; and I was.</p>
